!!!danger What now?
Talk about timing. Not even a full year. Will probably be back soon enough, but what if it doesn't?
The plan for now will be to do a full archive of /iemg/, dating back as far as possible from available archives.

Here's a list of concurrent /iemg/ threads. Enter which board you prefer in the survey above if you have a preference. Ideally, /iemg/ shouldn't be fractured but who knows, if you prefer having split regions for different anons then I don't mind.

[8chan.moe thread](https://8chan.moe/t/res/17869.html#17878)

For now, a [SimpleX chat](https://simplex.chat/contact#/?v=2-7&smp=smp%3A%2F%2F1OwYGt-yqOfe2IyVHhxz3ohqo3aCCMjtB-8wn4X_aoY%3D%40smp11.simplex.im%2FJI2RGyykbaYWF8UVH2vCp5AN6TpoE6gE%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-3%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEAWUPhhQmk1HQNd3kgpoMc7sBfeHdYUUxFMzGl7ls3wUw%253D%26srv%3D6ioorbm6i3yxmuoezrhjk6f6qgkc4syabh7m3so74xunb5nzr4pwgfqd.onion&data=%7B%22groupLinkId%22%3A%22LfNt1CKFAj11qOR7Di6p0A%3D%3D%22%7D) will be used if anyone wants to discuss what is going to happen and our options.

## IEMGazette Archive

The IEMGazette archive can be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/cchSBaBQ#WwAguZeGclZkxzvwVNSryQ). The archive contents and organization/structure are all laid out in the "\[IEMGazette Archive Organization and Rules\]" file.  

It currently contains the following:
- Monthly issues of the IEMGazette in three formats (PNG, PDF, TXT)
- squig.link / HypeTheSonics measurement scrape
- Gear pictures
- Measurements (picture and/or file)
- Size comparison database pictures
- And more...

## IEM size database project

A project for somewhat standardized pictures of IEMs is currently ongoing. Many issues still have to be ironed out; stay tuned!
Pictures can be found in the [archive](https://mega.nz/folder/cchSBaBQ#WwAguZeGclZkxzvwVNSryQ), for which differentt IEMs are noted in this [database](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/n2mA+-1PHR6zeFf7yeCm9bRbwlL993dLZajDduujqsI/embed/).

The rules so far are as follow:
- Include a solid reference for size, ideally a ruler. other references, such as an apple dongle, a usb c termination, and/or eartips are possible alternatives/add-ons
- The iems have to be "naked", with no eartips or cables attached (ok for reference). For multiple iems, align them properly, and use the same positions/angles
- Show two important sides: the faceplate size, and the depth of the iem, the latter also showcasing the nozzle size and angle
- Ensure the photo angle is as vertical as possible to eliminate possible dimension skewing
- Leave a decent margin around the photographed items
- Use a grid paper as the background if possible, and specify the grid size
