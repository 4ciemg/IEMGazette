# IEMGazette

!!!danger What now?
Talk about timing. Not even a full year. Will probably be back soon enough; below is the plan if it's over.
The plan will now be to do a full archive of /iemg/, dating back as far as possible from available archives.
If you are reading this, thank you. Keep an eye out for other projects and updates, as well as possible migration to other boards or platforms.
See you soon (hopefully)!

## IEMGazette Archive

The IEMGazette archive can be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/cchSBaBQ#WwAguZeGclZkxzvwVNSryQ). The archive contents and organization/structure are all laid out in the "\[IEMGazette Archive Organization and Rules\]" file.  

It currently contains the following:
- Monthly issues of the IEMGazette in three formats (PNG, PDF, TXT)
- squig.link / HypeTheSonics measurement scrape
- Gear pictures
- Measurements (picture and/or file)
- Size comparison database pictures
- And more...

## IEM size database project

A project for somewhat standardized pictures of IEMs is currently ongoing. Many issues still have to be ironed out; stay tuned!
Pictures can be found in the [archive](https://mega.nz/folder/cchSBaBQ#WwAguZeGclZkxzvwVNSryQ), for which differentt IEMs are noted in this [database](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/n2mA+-1PHR6zeFf7yeCm9bRbwlL993dLZajDduujqsI/embed/).

The rules so far are as follow:
- Include a solid reference for size, ideally a ruler. other references, such as an apple dongle, a usb c termination, and/or eartips are possible alternatives/add-ons
- The iems have to be "naked", with no eartips or cables attached (ok for reference). For multiple iems, align them properly, and use the same positions/angles
- Show two important sides: the faceplate size, and the depth of the iem, the latter also showcasing the nozzle size and angle
- Ensure the photo angle is as vertical as possible to eliminate possible dimension skewing
- Leave a decent margin around the photographed items
- Use a grid paper as the background if possible, and specify the grid size
