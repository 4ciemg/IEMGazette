###Recommended articles and videos

While not necessary to the guide, the readings from [Dale's Music Stuff](https://daystarvisions.com/Music/index.html) from HE1 up to HE7 are good, easy-to-digest yet in-depth articles that explain a lot of concepts and ideas that are immediately relevant to the task. It is focused on headphones, but the same general rules and suggestions also apply to IEMs. Reading them will provide much more information than what is given here in terms of audio and the hobby as a whole, while this guide is for the most part solely dedicated to EQ. Crinacle's [Graphs 101: How to Read Headphone Measurements](https://crinacle.com/2020/04/08/graphs-101-how-to-read-headphone-measurements/) is also an interesting read that dives into measurements and how to read them.
