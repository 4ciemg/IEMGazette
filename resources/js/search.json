The entire frequency response is equally resolving, with TOTL separation and imaging. There’s even some semblance of soundstage, with distinct areas of spaciousness (must be some driver fuckery from using 7 BAs).

There's decent imaging to the point your inner eye can almost see how an instrument is played.*The instrument separation is great; you can single out one as easily as a thread in fabric and follow it as the song goes on.*The detail retrieval is pretty nice; I've discovered new sounds in relatively familiar tracks (e.g., that background jingle in We Drift Like Worried Fire at around 4:50).*The bass is textured and full-bodied but very lively and dynamic, also punchy when it needs to be. It extends beyond the soundstage, adding a lot to the atmosphere, and is definitely the highlight of this IEM.*The vocals feel intimate and natural (note to myself: try listening to some ASMR), and the mids are pretty clean overall.*The treble is crisp but can be very shouty (esp. in games) to the point I'll have to use EQ. What the fuck were they thinking?*The channel imbalance is there. That pestering thought that you might be going deaf won't leave your mind once you've noticed it, even if you know about the imbalance.","The build and comfort are where my biggest disappointment comes from. The build is standard, but no attempt was made to make it slightly more ergonomic. The nozzles are huge, almost as huge as the pain in the ass you experience looking for the right eartips. At least the nozzles have lips. The cable is thick and seems durable, but it's fairly heavy and pulls on your ears, making this IEM rather uncomfortable and even painful to wear for prolonged periods of time.

Impressions: Coherent with clean, rumbling bass, the extra subbbass can be felt. Treble is more sparkly than Tea 2 but not fatiguing. Perhaps due to the slightly more emphasis to subbass and upper mid/treble, the mids sound drier. Easy to drive.","Bass: Tea Pro","Mids: Tea 2","Treble: depending on taste","Verdict: great set overall, side grade/different tuning to Tea 2.","Resin/metal build, feels solid, but the metal will mess up the resin faceplate when put together in your pocket that's for certain, plus the fact that in cold weather there might be condensation issues.","Good unboxing, plenty of accessories, cable has swappable connectors (3.5/4.4). There's a case but also a soft pouch so if you don't want bulk, you can use the pouch. Tips are not dogshit like Tea 2's stock but still just your average tips.","Tea 2s are now relegated to workout/jogging set, still love them plenty."]},{"l":"Tanchjim Mino Asano Tanch Edition Review","p":["08/01/2025","Tanchjim Mino anime version + goodies","I ordered from aliexpress/hifigo store and it came with a pin, postcard, acrylic stand and a pack of stickers inside the box.","As for the pos itself it sounds alright, about 5dB too bright in the upper mids and treble. It's also got that low fi bluetooth crunch in the upper treble, but that's with my desktop's built in bluetooth and god knows what codec. Build feels light and plasticky but comfort is good.","Graphs, Tanchjim with the godly channel matching as usual. Not sure what's happening below 30hz, gonna just chalk it up to BT weirdness. The app also comes with a 5 band PEQ. I use the following:","Filter 1: ON PK Fc 20 Hz Gain 5 dB Q 0.3","Filter 2: ON PK Fc 4000 Hz Gain -3 dB Q 0.6","Filter 3: ON PK Fc 5500 Hz Gain -4 dB Q 2","Filter 4: ON PK Fc 8500 Hz Gain 3 dB Q 1","Filter 5: ON PK Fc 10200 Hz Gain -4 dB Q 5"]},{"l":"KZ EDC Pro Stealth Revision","p":["06/01/2025","Here are the promised pics for the two EDC Pro samples I have. Top row is the old version (purchased early November), the bottom the new version (mid December).","I won't go into the details, but the main differences are: the filter is different as shown by the striation/grain and the driver basket/housing is different as shown by the different wiring and color/size of the magnet containment.","As for measurements, these were taken fresh out of the box, so no filter clogging or other issues should be present. Either the driver is different, which would explain the shift in resonant frequency between the two samples, or the filters are different enough to warrant this change.","Does this matter? Not really, the difference is relatively high-Q and small enough as to where I doubt most people will notice it. This silent revision is arguably quite harmless, and I still hold these very highly as per my previous review of them. If there's demand, I am willing to remove the filters and measure them, but I will not open them up to check the diaphragm and voice coil unless I plan on getting more samples (which I probably will do).","Yet again, I forgot the pic."]},{"i":"trn-mt5-measurements-n3","l":"TRN MT5 Measurements (n=3)","p":["06/01/2025","Got around to measuring my third sample of the TRN MT5 (top portion). Biggest letdown of the three, noticeable channel imbalance in the bass. The difference above 3 khz is also noticeable but only for the wideband change; the high-Q difference at 5 khz not so much, at least not consistently so. Hard to say if it's placebo or not. Quite disappointed with this, I retract any recommendations I have made previously. While the imbalance isn't horrible in the grand scheme of things, the standard for channel matching has moved on and these do not meet it.","The bottom graph shows my attempt at fixing one of the sides (purple). The front vent is blocked with a piece of tape, after which a small incision was made to tame the sub bass without losing on the gained mid bass. For the 3-8 khz range, a 300 mesh filter brings the right side close enough to where I would deem the channel matching as acceptable.","Here's the squig version for those that are more used to that format","Also please ignore the 90 hz, I don't give a fuck!","I'll start doing the EDC Pro revision posts, having a hard time getting a clear pic of the filter grain."]},{"l":"HiBy Yves Impressions","p":["06/01/2025","I bought a Hiby R1 and it came with these Yves IEMs, they sound like complete shit and very tinny.","These cheap Sony \"Comfortable Fit\" headphones(MDR-EX15LP) sound better than the Yves.","I'm wonder out of the two other IEMs which have better sound.
