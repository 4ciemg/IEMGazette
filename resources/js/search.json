The lyrics aren't particularly inspiring and the vocalist (at least in this album) has the range of a teaspoon so they would have to do something reasonably different in their other albums to keep me interested (first time listening to them). Also the music is nice but most tracks don't really have the depth that would keep me listening when I'm not preoccupied.

This was back when I didn't do my usual measurements.","Non-sound impressions: Built beautifully. I just love the way it looks with the logo. The Oxygen is similar, but lacks the refinement; the slight border that accentuates the shell shape, the angel logo without the lettering, the slight embossing against the gray face, everything adds up to what is in my opinion the best mirror finished IEM >I've seen in a while. The packaging is fine like what others have said. A bulky yet high quality case, excellent T-APB tips, useless nozzles that have modding potential, and a somewhat lackluster cable in that it behaves like custom cable without having the feel and weight of one. I switched mine out for a custom gray-ish cable that matches the stainless metal and look. The fit is fine. These things are seriously tiny, I thought they would be a bigger Oxygen/Hana in both thickness and shell size, but it seems like only the former is true. The faceplate/body is still really small, and the fit with the extended nozzle and thickness is much better than that of the Oxygen/Hana in my experience. It's not the most secure or custom molded experience, but it works.","First impressions: Bass is definitely the weakest link. It's present, it's good, but on certain tracks it lacks volume. Every bass instrument/track is present, but it's almost always never the center focus. The mids and treble are great. It's essentially a perfected female poison tuning; really vocal forward that skirts the line between being too bright/shouty and being \"revealing\". Overall, in terms of tonal balance, it's pretty great. Most impressive is the treble quality, they somehow managed to make 1DD that imo needs very little to no tweaking for my ears.","Techs and dreams: Overall, it's really tech-y for a 1DD. Soundstage is surprising; usually, a tuning quirk in FR is used to enhance soundstage. An example would be killing the upper midrange on the andromedas, or elevating the treble on many other sets. In my experience, I rarely notice this change in soundstage, and instead the flawed timbre is what pops out. For the Origin, the mix of very separated midrange and bass, with non-peaky yet still elevated treble creates a sense of soundstage that is subtle but noticeable. I don't think this effect is going to stay consistent or even be present for long after my brain gets used to it. The imaging is just like any other IEM, but the enhanced soundstage makes it seem like everything is more separated, leading to a seemingly more focused sound presentation. Bass techs are where I find them to be the most complicated to connect with FR. Soundstage and imaging become similar for different sets if I EQ them to proper timbre, but techs related to bass often requires much more effort to remediate. The Origin has very low bass, but using EQ is effective and requires little fiddling to get to good levels for genres that need it.","Ok final Origins impressions: It's great. Doing this type of very mid/treble forward signature is very hard because it has to be balanced. Many sets try to boost that 3-8khz region because this leads to usually leads to more clarity, but very few manage to make it work with good treble like the Origin does. And the treble is really good to my ears, to the point where I'm not even remotely tempted to use EQ. I don't really know of any other 1DD that is this clean, energetic, and competent in what it sets out to do. I still think the bass is a bit lacking. A small cut at 250hz with a shelf at 125 seems to round out everything, but I only use this for hip hop and rap. Most other genres fare just as, if not better with the stock tuning where the bloat compensates for the forward mids.","based Orijimmy. I spent some time the other day listening to the nozzles and settled on Light for my ears. Of course we know what the measurements say, but I encourage an earnest listen."]},{"l":"NiceHCK GreyDragon Impressions","p":["23/02/2025",">NiceHCK GreyDragon cable As expected of this style thicker 4-core cable.

Q1 Pro goes more for a semi-custom shape (but not pronounced at all), while the Q5 Pro is more like a Shure. It should come down to preference in terms of IEM stability and if you like filling your outer ear or not. They are as perfect as it can possibly get.","Build quality: Both are resin shells, they're good enough. The Q5 Pro is, in my opinion, not a looker, but it's not bad. The Q1 Pro is amazing, beautiful faceplate proportions and design.","Accessories: Q1 Pro is standard, the cable is actually above average as far as stock cables go. Not really pliable, but the kinks can be worked out fairly well. The Q5 Pro's cable is atrocious, feels as stiff as old Tanchjim cables, unusable. The tips are generic, the rest is also nothing worth pointing out.","Measurements show very good channel matching on both sets, as well as very good distortion metrics. Really just dominated by 2nd HD, with 3rd not even being measured properly due to my noise floor. Insertion depth measurements show expected behavior; the resonance at around 5khz does get a bit better with deeper insertion.","Sound quality on both is decent stock. Bright leaning, but there's at least an acceptable amount of bass, though not nearly enough for my taste. No immediate treble issues, but as always it could use some polishing. My EQ increases bass, reduces the 5khz range, and fixes the treble.","All in all, these are two excellent sets. While their sound quality is nothing special, and their accessories are decent, maybe even subpar, the comfort and build quality on these are so great that everything I just mentioned doesn't matter. I wholeheartedly recommend these for anyone and anything, they are just that nice fitting.","Here's a size comparison with other small fitting shells. The semi-custom one is the Tiandirenhe TD10MK2. They're all pretty good if comfort and fit is the priority. Both the EPZs are much better sounding stock, and are also my favorites in terms of comfort. The Tiandirenhe is also really good, but is slightly thicker (isolates better than the EPZs). The TinHifi T1S / T1 Plus are also very good, but aren't very stable for me. The last two also need a lot of EQ to sound good.","bro you didn't label the graphs tho. i assume left with the slightly more pronounced 5khz bump is q5 pro","Correct about which one is which Personally, when listening, I didn't find either of them to be all that different.","and how is the tiandirenhe?","Sucks that I did that review before the Gazette was a thing. In short, horrible without EQ, salvageable with. The only reason I got it is because it was (maybe still is) one of the cheapest, semi-custom IEMs out there.

There's a reason male vocals are so subdued, thinned out and lacking the necessary heft in Shartman-tuned pos. There are ways to make female vocals really shine without emasculating male vocals in such way, so why? The real aim of the Shartman target was to enhance vocals of troons. It's really simple: troons have unmistakably male voices, but they're trying hard to sound more female and escape what in their twisted minds is stigma and unfortunate fate, but their male vocal cords will always get in the way and reveal who they really are. That's why the Shartman target, which aimed to be another neutral diffuse field but developer further to add room-specific characteristics to the sound, has since strayed from the path of neutrality and, under the guise of being a target preferred by the general population, became a target which makes female vocals sound prominent and bright while performing castration on male vocals. Think of it: it's the logical way to rob tranny vocals from manly heft and emphasize the feminine shine troons try to obtain. The way the Shartman target executes it is with a deep, slightly recessed tuck in the midbass (often called \"tranny tuck\" here) to take from the depth and weight, while emphasizing 5kHz shrill to add upper harmonics that are much necessary to enhance femininity of vocals. As a result, troon vocals are noticably shifted towards feminine character, fulfilling their desire to mask their inescapable manly heft to a great extent."]},{"l":"Softears Volume S Detached Faceplate","p":["15/02/2025","another L do i put it back together with superglue or epoxy?","ive heard superglue fumes are bad for drivers and epoxy is safe","i think the original adhesive must have been super glue though",">moondropped literally Softears is Moondrop","use T7000 or B7000 there's different color depending on application if you need transparent get the B","You put in in the box and send it back under warranty."]},{"i":"eletech--jomo-audio-mass-impressions","l":"Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions","p":["13/02/2025","Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions Went to Eletech/Jomo Audio HQ today and demoed some pos:",">Ame Mousa Very warm with tamed treble.

The subbass is there for me until it goes to 40hz. Most of my music doesn't go that low but I do notice when rumble is missing on songs that have it. It can vibrate down to 1hz on a tone generator if I raise the volume, so maybe it's fixable with EQ. I thought the 10dB pinna gain was going to hurt me but it only gives some bite to guitars. Like the tryout anon said, the midbass is a little muddy and some vocals can sound veiled despite the pinna gain. It's song dependent.","That said, this IEM does give the feeling of \"soundstage\". It doesn't expand past your head or anything. What I mean is there is some extra space between instruments when they're being played at the same time.

It extends beyond the soundstage, adding a lot to the atmosphere, and is definitely the highlight of this IEM.*The vocals feel intimate and natural (note to myself: try listening to some ASMR), and the mids are pretty clean overall.*The treble is crisp but can be very shouty (esp. in games) to the point I'll have to use EQ. What the fuck were they thinking?*The channel imbalance is there. That pestering thought that you might be going deaf won't leave your mind once you've noticed it, even if you know about the imbalance. The build and comfort are where my biggest disappointment comes from. The build is standard, but no attempt was made to make it slightly more ergonomic. The nozzles are huge, almost as huge as the pain in the ass you experience looking for the right eartips. At least the nozzles have lips. The cable is thick and seems durable, but it's fairly heavy and pulls on your ears, making this IEM rather uncomfortable and even painful to wear for prolonged periods of time.

Impressions:","Coherent with clean, rumbling bass, the extra subbbass can be felt. Treble is more sparkly than Tea 2 but not fatiguing. Perhaps due to the slightly more emphasis to subbass and upper mid/treble, the mids sound drier. Easy to drive.","Bass: Tea Pro Mids: Tea 2 Treble: depending on taste","Verdict: great set overall, side grade/different tuning to Tea 2.","Resin/metal build, feels solid, but the metal will mess up the resin faceplate when put together in your pocket that's for certain, plus the fact that in cold weather there might be condensation issues. Good unboxing, plenty of accessories, cable has swappable connectors (3.5/4.4). There's a case but also a soft pouch so if you don't want bulk, you can use the pouch.

Top row is the old version (purchased early November), the bottom the new version (mid December). I won't go into the details, but the main differences are: the filter is different as shown by the striation/grain and the driver basket/housing is different as shown by the different wiring and color/size of the magnet containment. As for measurements, these were taken fresh out of the box, so no filter clogging or other issues should be present. Either the driver is different, which would explain the shift in resonant frequency between the two samples, or the filters are different enough to warrant this change. Does this matter? Not really, the difference is relatively high-Q and small enough as to where I doubt most people will notice it. This silent revision is arguably quite harmless, and I still hold these very highly as per my previous review of them. If there's demand, I am willing to remove the filters and measure them, but I will not open them up to check the diaphragm and voice coil unless I plan on getting more samples (which I probably will do).","KZ EDC Pro Stealth Revision Yet again, I forgot the pic."]},{"i":"trn-mt5-measurements-n3","l":"TRN MT5 Measurements (n=3)","p":["06/01/2025","TRN MT5 Measurements (n=3) Got around to measuring my third sample of the TRN MT5 (top portion). Biggest letdown of the three, noticeable channel imbalance in the bass. The difference above 3 khz is also noticeable but only for the wideband change; the high-Q difference at 5 khz not so much, at least not consistently so. Hard to say if it's placebo or not. Quite disappointed with this, I retract any recommendations I have made previously. While the imbalance isn't horrible in the grand scheme of things, the standard for channel matching has moved on and these do not meet it.","The bottom graph shows my attempt at fixing one of the sides (purple). The front vent is blocked with a piece of tape, after which a small incision was made to tame the sub bass without losing on the gained mid bass. For the 3-8 khz range, a 300 mesh filter brings the right side close enough to where I would deem the channel matching as acceptable.","TRN MT5 Measurements (n=3) Here's the squig version for those that are more used to that format Also please ignore the 90 hz, I don't give a fuck!
