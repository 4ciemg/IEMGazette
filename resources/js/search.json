The lyrics aren't particularly inspiring and the vocalist (at least in this album) has the range of a teaspoon so they would have to do something reasonably different in their other albums to keep me interested (first time listening to them). Also the music is nice but most tracks don't really have the depth that would keep me listening when I'm not preoccupied.

This was back when I didn't do my usual measurements.","Non-sound impressions: Built beautifully. I just love the way it looks with the logo. The Oxygen is similar, but lacks the refinement; the slight border that accentuates the shell shape, the angel logo without the lettering, the slight embossing against the gray face, everything adds up to what is in my opinion the best mirror finished IEM >I've seen in a while. The packaging is fine like what others have said. A bulky yet high quality case, excellent T-APB tips, useless nozzles that have modding potential, and a somewhat lackluster cable in that it behaves like custom cable without having the feel and weight of one. I switched mine out for a custom gray-ish cable that matches the stainless metal and look. The fit is fine. These things are seriously tiny, I thought they would be a bigger Oxygen/Hana in both thickness and shell size, but it seems like only the former is true. The faceplate/body is still really small, and the fit with the extended nozzle and thickness is much better than that of the Oxygen/Hana in my experience. It's not the most secure or custom molded experience, but it works.","First impressions: Bass is definitely the weakest link. It's present, it's good, but on certain tracks it lacks volume. Every bass instrument/track is present, but it's almost always never the center focus. The mids and treble are great. It's essentially a perfected female poison tuning; really vocal forward that skirts the line between being too bright/shouty and being \"revealing\". Overall, in terms of tonal balance, it's pretty great. Most impressive is the treble quality, they somehow managed to make 1DD that imo needs very little to no tweaking for my ears.","Techs and dreams: Overall, it's really tech-y for a 1DD. Soundstage is surprising; usually, a tuning quirk in FR is used to enhance soundstage. An example would be killing the upper midrange on the andromedas, or elevating the treble on many other sets. In my experience, I rarely notice this change in soundstage, and instead the flawed timbre is what pops out. For the Origin, the mix of very separated midrange and bass, with non-peaky yet still elevated treble creates a sense of soundstage that is subtle but noticeable. I don't think this effect is going to stay consistent or even be present for long after my brain gets used to it. The imaging is just like any other IEM, but the enhanced soundstage makes it seem like everything is more separated, leading to a seemingly more focused sound presentation. Bass techs are where I find them to be the most complicated to connect with FR. Soundstage and imaging become similar for different sets if I EQ them to proper timbre, but techs related to bass often requires much more effort to remediate. The Origin has very low bass, but using EQ is effective and requires little fiddling to get to good levels for genres that need it.","Ok final Origins impressions: It's great. Doing this type of very mid/treble forward signature is very hard because it has to be balanced. Many sets try to boost that 3-8khz region because this leads to usually leads to more clarity, but very few manage to make it work with good treble like the Origin does. And the treble is really good to my ears, to the point where I'm not even remotely tempted to use EQ. I don't really know of any other 1DD that is this clean, energetic, and competent in what it sets out to do. I still think the bass is a bit lacking. A small cut at 250hz with a shelf at 125 seems to round out everything, but I only use this for hip hop and rap. Most other genres fare just as, if not better with the stock tuning where the bloat compensates for the forward mids.","based Orijimmy. I spent some time the other day listening to the nozzles and settled on Light for my ears. Of course we know what the measurements say, but I encourage an earnest listen."]},{"l":"NiceHCK GreyDragon Impressions","p":["23/02/2025",">NiceHCK GreyDragon cable As expected of this style thicker 4-core cable.

Q1 Pro goes more for a semi-custom shape (but not pronounced at all), while the Q5 Pro is more like a Shure. It should come down to preference in terms of IEM stability and if you like filling your outer ear or not. They are as perfect as it can possibly get.","Build quality: Both are resin shells, they're good enough. The Q5 Pro is, in my opinion, not a looker, but it's not bad. The Q1 Pro is amazing, beautiful faceplate proportions and design.","Accessories: Q1 Pro is standard, the cable is actually above average as far as stock cables go. Not really pliable, but the kinks can be worked out fairly well. The Q5 Pro's cable is atrocious, feels as stiff as old Tanchjim cables, unusable. The tips are generic, the rest is also nothing worth pointing out.","Measurements show very good channel matching on both sets, as well as very good distortion metrics. Really just dominated by 2nd HD, with 3rd not even being measured properly due to my noise floor. Insertion depth measurements show expected behavior; the resonance at around 5khz does get a bit better with deeper insertion.","Sound quality on both is decent stock. Bright leaning, but there's at least an acceptable amount of bass, though not nearly enough for my taste. No immediate treble issues, but as always it could use some polishing. My EQ increases bass, reduces the 5khz range, and fixes the treble.","All in all, these are two excellent sets. While their sound quality is nothing special, and their accessories are decent, maybe even subpar, the comfort and build quality on these are so great that everything I just mentioned doesn't matter. I wholeheartedly recommend these for anyone and anything, they are just that nice fitting.","Here's a size comparison with other small fitting shells. The semi-custom one is the Tiandirenhe TD10MK2. They're all pretty good if comfort and fit is the priority. Both the EPZs are much better sounding stock, and are also my favorites in terms of comfort. The Tiandirenhe is also really good, but is slightly thicker (isolates better than the EPZs). The TinHifi T1S / T1 Plus are also very good, but aren't very stable for me. The last two also need a lot of EQ to sound good.","bro you didn't label the graphs tho. i assume left with the slightly more pronounced 5khz bump is q5 pro","Correct about which one is which Personally, when listening, I didn't find either of them to be all that different.","and how is the tiandirenhe?","Sucks that I did that review before the Gazette was a thing. In short, horrible without EQ, salvageable with. The only reason I got it is because it was (maybe still is) one of the cheapest, semi-custom IEMs out there.

There's a reason male vocals are so subdued, thinned out and lacking the necessary heft in Shartman-tuned pos. There are ways to make female vocals really shine without emasculating male vocals in such way, so why? The real aim of the Shartman target was to enhance vocals of troons. It's really simple: troons have unmistakably male voices, but they're trying hard to sound more female and escape what in their twisted minds is stigma and unfortunate fate, but their male vocal cords will always get in the way and reveal who they really are. That's why the Shartman target, which aimed to be another neutral diffuse field but developer further to add room-specific characteristics to the sound, has since strayed from the path of neutrality and, under the guise of being a target preferred by the general population, became a target which makes female vocals sound prominent and bright while performing castration on male vocals. Think of it: it's the logical way to rob tranny vocals from manly heft and emphasize the feminine shine troons try to obtain. The way the Shartman target executes it is with a deep, slightly recessed tuck in the midbass (often called \"tranny tuck\" here) to take from the depth and weight, while emphasizing 5kHz shrill to add upper harmonics that are much necessary to enhance femininity of vocals. As a result, troon vocals are noticably shifted towards feminine character, fulfilling their desire to mask their inescapable manly heft to a great extent."]},{"l":"Softears Volume S Detached Faceplate","p":["15/02/2025","another L do i put it back together with superglue or epoxy?","ive heard superglue fumes are bad for drivers and epoxy is safe","i think the original adhesive must have been super glue though",">moondropped literally Softears is Moondrop","use T7000 or B7000 there's different color depending on application if you need transparent get the B","You put in in the box and send it back under warranty."]},{"i":"eletech--jomo-audio-mass-impressions","l":"Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions","p":["13/02/2025","Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions Went to Eletech/Jomo Audio HQ today and demoed some pos:",">Ame Mousa Very warm with tamed treble.

The subbass is there for me until it goes to 40hz. Most of my music doesn't go that low but I do notice when rumble is missing on songs that have it. It can vibrate down to 1hz on a tone generator if I raise the volume, so maybe it's fixable with EQ. I thought the 10dB pinna gain was going to hurt me but it only gives some bite to guitars. Like the tryout anon said, the midbass is a little muddy and some vocals can sound veiled despite the pinna gain. It's song dependent.","That said, this IEM does give the feeling of \"soundstage\". It doesn't expand past your head or anything. What I mean is there is some extra space between instruments when they're being played at the same time.

One thing I hated about the P7 was that panning sounds would quickly snap from one side to the other and barely touch the center. The Volume S does it normally I guess.

It extends beyond the soundstage, adding a lot to the atmosphere, and is definitely the highlight of this IEM.*The vocals feel intimate and natural (note to myself: try listening to some ASMR), and the mids are pretty clean overall.*The treble is crisp but can be very shouty (esp. in games) to the point I'll have to use EQ. What the fuck were they thinking?*The channel imbalance is there. That pestering thought that you might be going deaf won't leave your mind once you've noticed it, even if you know about the imbalance. The build and comfort are where my biggest disappointment comes from. The build is standard, but no attempt was made to make it slightly more ergonomic. The nozzles are huge, almost as huge as the pain in the ass you experience looking for the right eartips. At least the nozzles have lips. The cable is thick and seems durable, but it's fairly heavy and pulls on your ears, making this IEM rather uncomfortable and even painful to wear for prolonged periods of time.

As for measurements, these were taken fresh out of the box, so no filter clogging or other issues should be present. Either the driver is different, which would explain the shift in resonant frequency between the two samples, or the filters are different enough to warrant this change. Does this matter?

At higher volumes, S12 2024’s planar timbre is worse than the T10 – cymbals have an unnatural shimmer and wind instruments have a metallic sheen. Also, the S12 2024 is prone to sibilance, so tip-rolling is required. I found DUNU S&S tips to work but foam tips would be better.","Comparisons with Artti T10 S12 2024 sounds a tad cleaner than the T10 but articulation is sometimes sharpened to the point of harshness. Call it “better techs” if you want, but I’d still choose the T10 because it isn’t as sibilant/painful to listen to. Ultimately both planars sound very similar and any difference is just a nitpicking exercise.","Comparisons with Mega5-EST The S12 2024 does sound more detailed than the Mega5est probably since the S12 has a noticeably quicker bass decay which gives it a cleaner midrange and better instrument separation.","New meta IEMs (like the DaVinci, KE4) sound muddy in comparison, but I wouldn’t call the S12 2024 a highly resolving set, since the S12’s excessive \"SH\" and \"S\" energy in female vocals can occasionally overpower the treble and cause higher pitch instruments to sound less detailed (masking the shimmer from cymbals and jingle from the tambourine).","Cons The set is library/track dependent. Poor fit for jpop/kpop. I want to say instrumentals/classical is fine since I liked Vivaldi on the S12 2024, but it’s a genre with high dynamic range so I’ve had tracks cross into the harshness threshold even on low volume.","inb4 planars are not meant for listening at high volume At low volume the S12 2024 is painfully average.

Now obviously we don't have to scour each and every pos that was ever mentioned but we have to at least have to put up the more notable ones into a hall of fame of sorts for posterity's sake it will be our very own pos encyclopaedia","ok so obviously given the very high activity in this thread, the option of going back through everything is not feasible at all. for now, i will try to go through all the threads that are still alive, but further than that is impossible the plan for now is not set in stone. im not sure if it is better to just keep the rentry as a live thing, where \"articles\" are consistently added and updated for everyone to see, or if i should do a recurring update (record everything happening in a week, month, quarter, or any time period, and then update it at the end. eg recording everything for september, and then uploading said content at the beginning of october) in both cases, i will have to remove articles, which i plan on doing by simply exporting the pdf/png of the site and storing it online for everyone to look back. as for the original image file, im still debating whether or not i should include them (maybe just for ones that really need it)","Future plans after the update.","the plan for now is to update it as frequently as i can, which is to say quite frequently (almost daily) i got the hang of the formatting for now. since this isn't a purely archival project, i decided that i could change of some of the included posts to better match the formatting (the content itself will NEVER change). this can be seen in the top 3 article where i decided to number each post for consistency. ill also be setting up an archive that will contain every picture used and article produced thus far (probably will be separated by month). thats it for now, the workflow is pretty optimal. ill check back in a month to see if the schedule, quality, and satisfaction is good or needs improving.","nigga this shit ain't gonna last","thats what ill be looking at. i looked back through the last 7-9 threads, and was surprised to find out how little worthwhile content there was (without being that strict with quality), so the \"work\" is very minimal, and is for the most part sustainable. if it really is too much, it can just be scrapped (or transferred to someone else if theyre this masochistic) or i can be very strict with the quality and only update here and there."]},{"l":"Kinera Celest Wyvern Abyss Impressions","p":["08/09/2024","Kinera Celest Wyvern Abyss Impressions{30%:50%} new pos just rolled in pros:>comfy>sounds pretty good(with EQ)>detachable mic>nice design cons:>no lip to keep the tips from sliding down the nozzle (who tf though this is a good idea)>big(stick out more then i'd like)>mic port on cable stabs cheek solid 7/10 pos"]},{"l":"Gate and Tempotec Sonata III Impressions","p":["07/09/2024","{30%:30%} My first chinkshit arrived a few days ago. After testing them, here are my thoughts for anyone considering any of these two. I'm gonna use them mostly on a S22. The Tempotec Sonata HD III is quite decent for its price, in some devices, like my laptop, my Switch or low end phones with headphone jacks, it improves the sound and max volume by a LOT, on my desktop PC it's about the same level. Absolutely not a single sound or hissing when nothing is playing or connected. It's built like a tank, very heavy metal frame. Conclusion: absolutely recommended. The Gatos are, unsurprisingly, what you can expect for 20 freedombucks. They are not bad by any metric, and better than pretty much everything else not chink on this price bracket and maybe a little more. The bass is non existent unless you EQ, then it's kinda there. They are on the brighter side in general, lower treble is good, but when you go higher it shits the bed, also hi-hats sound awful. The mids and vocals are okayish, but very straightforward which I personally like. I can't talk about fit because my ear canal is weird and I never had a single in-ear fit in there snuggly. Build materials are just right for something worth $20. Conclusion: good bang for the buck, even better if you EQ to your taste, but that applies to everything I guess.

Been wanting a pair for a while now. It looks absolutely gorgeous with its deep blue shell. Cable is nice as well, but it is quite microphonic. These fit me perfectly after bending the ear hook a bit because it was wound too tight. Turning is very comfortable, zero fatigue, separation is great, fantastic for almost all genres. Playing Pick Up the Pieces by Average White Band, all instruments are given respect, nothing sounds either too thin or bloated, its a joy to listen to. The biggest con is that male vocals take a huge hit, and some genres feel exceptionally thin. For example, they cant handle motown. These totally strip away the vocal power of Stevie Wonder or Marvin Gaye. I couldn't fix this with tip rolling. In conclusion, beautiful pair with comfortable tuning that's good for most genres except ones focusing on male vocals.","how's the nozzle? has it destroyed your holes?","These nozzles are beastly.

Poor fit, constantly slipping out if I yawn or smile and thin sound like those shitty wired earbuds we used to get with phones like 15 years ago. They came with my phone, and I also had the jabra elite 85ts until one of them fell out at work and I never found it. The jabras were better in every conceivable way, and the only reason one of them fell out was because I was pulling myself up into a roof and my left shoulder brushed up against my ear. They fit well, stayed in at the gym/work, they were comfy, and they sounded good, better than the sony xb700s I had before them. The buds 2 pros are worse than the xb700s were. I'm actually going out to buy a pair of xm5s in like an hour because I don't want to keep using the buds 2 pros, I'll let you know if they also suck","Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and TWS opinions{30%:30%} Updoot: The snoys are alright, the fit isn't quite as good as the 85ts but I haven't tried the other eartips yet.

I received the package like 2 weeks ago, and it's been a great experience, no problems whatsoever. I was listening to some music when the battery went low, after some hours, pretty normal until then. So I put it back to charge and after 2 hours I took them out to listen to some music again but I noticed that there were basically no sound or return from the device. Strange because the charging case i working, blinking the green light etc. So I thought, hm maybe the charging case went shit, then I tried to charge the golden ages with the space travel charging case and didn't charged a bit. Strange, so I tried to charge my space travel inside the golden ages charging case and it charged normally. So I think my golden ages simply don't get charging anymore. And yes, it's clean, no dirt whatsoever in any hole or connector. What should I do now?
