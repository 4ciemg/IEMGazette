The comfort is above average but unfortunately the vent is mostly fake. Its still one of the most open IEMs out there but between this and the Illustrious, its not even close. It isolates slightly less than the Fola, which is also more open than your average single DD.","Sound is decent, I hear the standard single DD 10K+ treble peak, but its not especially bad and everything else is basically where it should be for a single DD. If you've bought more than a few 1DD FOTMs you probably know exactly how FR sounds. This and the Fola sound almost identical actually, but I'd say the Fola is the better package on sale because it has a modular cable with USB C. What I will give the Balance credit for is coming with a nutsack which puts it into the same class as kilobuck IEMs like the Softears Turii.","The Fola also takes a mild L for channel matching. Tanchjim fell off? On the other hand the Fola shells don't have the Origin bulge so the comfort is improved. Sound wise this is almost the exact same as the balance, and pretty much the same as the Origin as well with maybe a bit less treble. There's no reason to buy the Origin anymore, considering this has a better looking design (in my opinion), a better accessory package and slightly better tuning for a lower price.",">Barely OK channel matching, but otherwise I like the Balance. I thought this was supposed to be the usp of the Balance. It says they check each pair by hand to make sure the channel balance is perfect.","\"channel matching,\" for nearly all manufacturers is ~ 2db tolerance. better manufacturers and your luck determine how much better or worse your pos is",">early all manufacturers is ~ 2db tolerance source? is that a manufacturing standard somewhere?","NTA but usually most manufacturers will \"adhere\" to something like that. From the few I've talked with, channel matching is only considered a big issue (ie warranty viable) when it's in a wide range and more than 3 dB. I agree with anon, most manufacturers will have tolerances in those ranges, and more established brands will tighten that more (eg Tanchjim)."]},{"l":"Tangzu x Azla Noirblanc Review","p":["05-06/12/2025","Acessories: Comes with the usual things you see at this price: a round zip case (with a very cool motif on the cover), a 2 core modular cable, and a selection of tips that include Tangzu's Noble tips in all four sizes, and a set of Azla Origin tips. The cable is without a doubt my favorite stock cable. It's soft, pliable, has no memory, and looks incredible with the IEMs. The selection of tips is also great, and they are different enough to fit almost everyone (Nobles are short, and the Origin are quite long).","And here's a pic for channel matching in squig. The scale makes it look bad in REW but the largest deviation is 0.7 dB. Couldn't really hear it at all","at least it looks good on the bookshelf. thats the most important thing","Build and comfort: These are fantastic. Compact and lightweight metal shells with slight contouring allows them to fit snuggly inside of the ear. and they are not thick at all, being very similar to the Q1 Pro, Bunny, and Gate. The faceplate is also gorgeous, and the biggest reason why I bought these with the elegant flower motif surrounded by a nice metal perimeter that highlights the shape of the IEM. They isolate quite well, a tiny bit above average.","Channel Matching: Not meaningful but quite disappointing. I expected a bit more precision here but it's within the realm of normal deviations.","Conclusion: I bought these for one reason (the faceplate and overall beauty of it) and they not only delivered on that end, but also on a lot of other stuff such as the very good accessories and surprising comfort. And yes, I bought these knowing full well how they sounded and measured. In the end, this is probably the best purchase I've made this year purely based off of enjoyment. Sound quality out of the box was bad, but does it really matter when it can be fixed easily and everything else is so good?","Distortion: Measured at 104 dB as per usual, and again there isn't much to see. It is interesting to see the change from second to third harmonic and back to second.","I've been using them without swapping for any other IEM ever since I got them.","Insertion Depth: Deeper does help, but treble extension is still a problem. Nothing major, but it's worth pointing out. To make these sound good, EQ is mandatory. Thankfully the changes aren't complicated, and 3 filters (one for midbass, one for lowering 5-8 kHz region, one for treble extension) are enough to make this go from bad to excellent","is gazettzo even back tho bro","Seems dead","Sound: Not great. In fact, not good. It aims for HarmanIE2019, but somehow emphasizes the worst aspects: the midbass scoop is very pronounced, the 5-8 kHz region is boosted even above the 2-5 kHz ear gain, and there is little treble extension. And yet somehow, it is not the worst stock tuning I have.

Their PC software doesn't really work on Linux so I'll try it out later.","Again, can't comment much on the sound yet but I'm very much enjoying it. Good default tuning (only tried DSP so far) and good details. But disclaimer is that I'm someone who believes a $90 pair of pos can already be endgame material. Also this is first Tanch I bought so I can't compare to their other supposedly identical sets. That said, I'm definitely selling my B3's.","Yeah, impressions from yesterday remain. I really like the Fola, might as well be my endgame. The nozzles are a complete gimmick, but good in case you lose or damage one idk, stick to Standard. I also prefer default DSP slightly to Analog. Most defining characteristic sound wise is how clear and detailed it is, but without sounding sparkly. Some tracks with female vocals sounded very... Sweet? Velvety? I don't know how else to describe then. They are very small, almost Chu sized, so people with big ears might not like them. Nozzles are thick and hard to put default tips on, I've just been using Sancai Nobles.","heard decent things, glad you found something you enjoy - feel like IEM space is a neverending chase through cheap shit for most people, so settling has to be enlightening.","Thank you, I am feeling pretty satisfied right now.

So far, they seem to be exactly what I thought they'd be; the perfect upgrade to the Fiio FH3. The overall sound/tuning is very similar, but refined. It doesn't have the sharp peaks that the Fiio has, and the bass is even better. Unboxing experience was really cool. Definitely the most high end feel I've had with an IEM. Also, they look really cool in-ears. You can turn up the volume with these, and it never sounds harsh or sibilant. At the same time, it never sounds dark or muddy. Everything is really balanced. They shine at higher volumes with rock, hiphop etc.","Went out for like 2 hours with this. Man, is it good. You know how hard it usually is to judge how much an IEM is worth, right? Like you can take a cheap one and an expensive one, and sometimes it can be hard to tell them apart. You compare the build quality, the sound, everything, and you just can't tell. Well, with this one, you can immediately tell it's worth $300, in the same way you can tell a KZ EDC Pro is worth $15-$30 and an Aful Explorer is worth $100. The step up is just that big. This Shanling is three times better than my Fiio FH3 and Aful Explorer. That includes sound quality, build, isolation, etc. On my 2 hour walk with these outside I noticed that they isolate better with silicon tips than my Explorers do with foam tips. That's pretty massive. The shells are heavy, yes, but that probably contributes to the excellent sound isolation. Next, the sound... it's fucking great. It sounds like speakers. You can turn up the volume and just enjoy. Nothing is muddy. Everything is crystal clear but powerful, and at the same time never sibilant or annoying. This is the only iem together with the Aful Explorer that I think is safe to recommend for someone who does not intend to EQ (or don't know how). There simply aren't any resonance peaks to worry about here.","could you show us a track the shanling had you notice things better than your other pos? like what song had the most drastic changes when listening with different pos?","It sounded good no matter the song or genre. I listened to rock, blues, rap, vocals and instrumentals. Bass is great (clean but punchy), vocals (both male and female) are natural, neither recessed or shouty, and instruments are natural too.","Just before I got home this song went on:","And it sounded just like it does on my speakers. I had relatively high volume on, and if I had listened to this on any of my other iems (except the Explorer), the guitar that starts around 15 seconds into the song would've hurt my ears. Not on this. But there was nothing recessed about the guitar and how it sounded. It was loud and in your face (like it should be), but not harsh or piercing.","The Aful Explorer also has this \"feature\", where certain sounds never really kill your ear drums. However, the Shanling has better more natural sound overall. The Explorer is too recessed in the upper mids, and lacks mid bass punch. The Shanling has a much clearer, less thick sound, with way better bass - but it still retains the non-fatiguing qualities of the Explorer."]},{"l":"Intuaura Balance & ARTTI T10 Pro Impressions","p":["25-26/11/2025","First impression: Both sound nice and are super comfortable to wear.","Artti T10 Pro:> Small shells> Almost weightless> Looks clean and beautiful> Sound/tuning is very nice.

Impressions with the Sovereign Symphony 8W. Unofficial cable from Nightjar and MSRP is around 15,000 SGD (not sure about US pricing).",">Ergonomics 0/10. This cable is literally painful to use long-term. Normally when I wear the Storm with the stock Mira cable, the 2pins are angled inwards, pointing towards my head, but the earhooks and 2pin connectors for the SS8W are fucking massive. There’s no room left for an inward angle and this changes the insertion angle for the Storm as well. The Storm is tilted upwards and exerts pressure on my ear canal which becomes sore after just 30mins.","Even when stationary I’ve got to be mindful of how I wear it. The weight of the earhook tugs on my IEMs and so I gradually lose seal whenever I turn my head. It kinda helps if I rest the entire weight of the cable on the table but that means leaning back is out of the question.","Walkability is surprisingly decent with the cable tho.",">Sound quality (A/B’d with stock Mira MK2 cable) SS8W is a U-shape, bright-leaning cable as compared to the stock Mira. For some reason, on the same volume step, the SS8W sounds louder – possibly due to lower output impedance? Or maybe the boosted coloration is just more audible.","On “Bloody Mary” by Lady Gaga, the opening background static is more audible with the SS8W. Bass is slightly louder but also bloomy, Mira’s bass is definitely tighter and better controlled.","The bright-leaning nature of the SS8W is more audible on weebshit like “Hoshizora no Memoria” and “あの輝きを忘れない” (both by Chata). Chata’s vocals sound a tad more laidback and less shouty on the SS8W (maybe it stages wider?), and cymbals sound more extended.","On Shadow Shape by Hatsuki Yura, I can hear the same bright nature of the cable – more treble texture, but bass sounds slightly muddy and not as tight as the Mira MK2.

Too lazy, didn't take pics, sorry.","Accessories: Average, which means it's relatively good, and for the price, great. You can get these for around $10, and the accessories are acceptable. There is nothing that immediately needs to be replaced, the cable and tips are fine and work well enough with the IEMs. The cable handles itself very well: it is very thin (think of the white cable that came with some TinHifi IEMs) but has practically no memory. The Y split design is old but doesn't bother me and the strain reliefs are good.","Comfort: The shell is rather strange and is slanted, and when worn, the nozzle will twist and angle itself properly, in turn making the slanted faceplate be parallel to the ear. However, the fitting is weird, and in my experience requires a lot of trial and error with tips. The earhooks also hampered fit security a lot, so I removed them. In my opinion this is mandatory since the shell of the IEM only relies on the nozzle/eartip for security, it does not rest anywhere in the ear.","Pic shows the channel matching on top, and the effects of covering the vents on the bottom.","Sound: I won't go into detail, it sounds fine, bassy and decent timbre. Honestly sounds like a Wan'er with more treble and a bit more bass, both changes that I like.","Channel matching: I've seen worse, I've seen better. It is far from good, and the discrepancy is big and wide enough to be slightly audible. I wouldn't be bothered after a while but it is a bit disappointing. The only real issue is everything below 1khz, the rest above is small enough to not be distracting.","Vents: The effects of covering the front and back vents are as expected, but the changes are decent. You can cover the front to have more bass, cover the back to decrease bass, or both to reduce the region around 100hz. Too much of a hassle for me, I would just use EQ.","Distortion: Nothing much to say, inaudible and stuff. Surprising amount of 3H but that's that. 104dB.","Insertion depth: Shit looks so cool. Anyways it looks good, pretty much the same changes as seen with others. I have to remind you all that the range (7-10khz) is probably shifted higher in frequency, it should be probably be around 5.5-9khz, although since the Ruta is very small it is probably higher.","Conclusion: Another IEM that is well built, measures nicely, and fits fine. I don't feel strongly about it, get it if you want to. I do think it's a fine addition to the OP, it is basically a Wan'er with better build and increased treble. The differences are relatively small ccompared to others so I wouldn't fret over it. I prefer it over the Gate and Wan'er. I would take the Q1 Pro and Bunny over it.","are you deaf? otherwise its odd to prefer shartman treble rape over ruta10","Are you referring to what I prefer? If so, the Q1 Pro fits me much better.

The pos I have now I enjoy them in this order: EPZ P50 => Tanchjim Origin > Chopin => Nova >> Kiwi Ears Astral I tried the Origin first and I was surprised by how pleasant the signature was. From the frequency curve I wasn't expecting it. It's definitely bright leaning but the mid bass hump compensates for it perfectly. My only complaint would be the heavy-weight shells; they feel premium but they fall off if I try to sleep with them. The P50 were underwhelming at first but I later realized how balanced it is; nothing stands out too much and everything is a relaxed listen. My favorite set so far as this is what I usually look for. Very comfortable, I also ordered a custom design as I don't like the original look very much, nice option. The KE Astral were a complete disappointment. They definitely are fun at first but they have an absolute ridiculous high treble peak (9dB! @ 15kHz) which is extremely noticeable, everything sounds unnaturally airy and cymbals sound disgusting. Not sure why reviewers don't comment this, so far I've only seen TimTuned mention it but it totally ruins the set for me, otherwise they'd be fine. I can only think that most people who review these already have some hearing loss above 14kHz and thus don't notice it. But it sounds terrible to me, especially if coming from other pos/headphones/speakers. I can hear up to 17kHz and I'm sure many people here can too so I definitely wouldn't recommend them. The Chopin/Nova are my favorite Harman sets, but I don't enjoy Harman too much. The Chopin are more comfortable to wear and are more fun, but the mid bass hump is a bit too much for me. The Nova are more relaxed (which I enjoy more) but I had to change the eartips as they started to fall off and the female 2-pin plug of the left side doesn't hold the male connector anymore and they fall off so I don't use them anymore.",">sleeping with origins lol>nothing stands out too much and everything is a relaxed listen. true, nothing special but that's what's special about it in a way>Not sure why reviewers don't comment this i also had a very prominent peak in the treble but i think this might be an hrtf and hearing age issue",">i think this might be an hrtf and hearing age issue The peak is prominent in the measurements I've seen.

These might replace the ED9 pro as my favorite bullet IEMs. They don't stick out far at all, I can sleep on my side with these against the pillow. Great overall balance and imaging.

Maybe this'll help someone. The Tripowin Zonie is noticeably less microphonic than the stock cable, but still has some rumble when I move my head around. With the higher quality feeling cable comes a lot of extra weight though, and sometimes I'd rather have something lighter like the stock cable. I prefer the Zonie and will keep using it. I had to remove the plastic rings from the cable's MMCX connectors to get it to fit the IE200, which is a massive negative (for the IE200). The Final Audio E tips at SS size are almost the same size as the stock silicon tips at S size, so no significant changes in comfort. Isolation is around the same, slightly better at isolating treble than stock. I find it hard to a/b test these accurately, but changes in sound are not drastic at all. There might be slightly more bass. The most important difference, and the reason why I got these tips, is that the treble has improved for my ears. The stock tips had a weird sibilant, thin sound for my ears; S-sounds were harsh, sometimes almost like white noise (a subjective effect, of course). Final Audio E tips made the treble softer, still pronounced, but way nicer. I have the tape mod applied too just in case. The under-performing IE200 is very enjoyable with these and I'm glad to finally have an IEM that agrees with my ears.",">The stock tips had a weird sibilant, thin sound for my ears of course it's sibilant lmao ie200 is a horrible sibilant piece of shit and its awful treble is getting boosted by your length mode resonance"]},{"l":"Soundpeats T3 Pro Impressions","p":["27/08/2025","I fell for the scarbir shill and bought the soundpeats t3 pro sounds like sh* t Never trusting this kite again"]},{"l":"Chat is this true?","p":["19/08/2025","/iemg/ facts:>no one itt listens to music>no one itt enjoys music>everyone itt has no friends>everyone itt thinks contrarianism will make them cool>everyone itt are seething virgins"]},{"l":"Shenzhen International Audio Show (SIAS) 2025","p":[">innovation we've hit the ceiling in what we can do with pos.... what do you want???",">no customization Literal garbage.",">no innovation>no good budget deals>no originality GRIM AS FUCK",">Seeaudio next flagship in the seeapex series, support customization in shell and tuning, cost even more than the Mobius I ( 7800$ ) Mogged by g10.",">Spacetravel 2 Damn is it finally time to upgrade my wireless pos?

I had two reasons for doing so -- I found a good deal for them used at a fair price, and they have a small nozzle diameter. The smallest stock silicone tips are the only ones that fit my baby ears. If the nozzle was even a millimeter larger in diameter, I doubt it'd fit. Sound is good. Nothing compared to my planars yeah, but good. A little hollow. I did the tape mod and took damping foam from another pair of the stock tips and added that to the ones I use for double damping, which slightly reduced some sibilance I was experiencing. Chi-fi at the same price range obviously beats these, but for my circumstances (baby ears) these are very good.

Sound quality is as expected. If you are familiar with jm-1 tuning well... that's basically what it is. Nice bass, smooth treble, great mids. Do they sound that different from my vaguely jm-1 tuned SM4s? Not really? But on the other hand I don't really feel the need to fuck with EQ (outside of ear canal resonance). Surprisingly standard medium eartips were pretty comfortable but using spring tips just brings comfort to another level. And relaxes treble even more which is nice. Tried triple falange tips too... They made sound very shouty and basically unlistenable for me which is the first time I get such an effect with them lol. I got coffee tips too but they are couple of days away still.

Decent ear tip variety, but run-of-the-mill quality. The thicker core dark grey tips work fine. Cable checks most boxes: threaded screw lock for modular end (3.5 and 4.4 plugs), good gauge 4-core weave, lightweight hardware bits, and functional chin slider (tight but stays in place). Main nitpick is that it holds some memory kinks, but otherwise a solid stock cable. Shells are above average size and modest weight. There is no attempt at pseudocustom molding, they've gone with a featureless smoothed oblong shape. I can find comfortable fit and seal, but I consider it far from ideal shell ergonomics and shape.>Listening Specs Impressions done with stock tips, stock cable, and Black nozzle. Average sensitivity. Easy to drive, but not hyper revealing of source noise floor. Average scalability, upper midrange tonal issues are more prominent at higher volumes.>Overall Sound Cohesive, enveloping, and musical jack of all trades. Kefine generally doesn't shy away from low-end body and warmth, nor do they cross into \"basshead,\" territory. Robust low frequencies lay a solid foundation for crisp midrange and treble. There are no significant peaks, but there are clear deviations from DF from 1.5kHz-6kHz. Instruments and vocals in this range step forward in the mix, and can present as a bit too frontal at times. This area is also where the main differences between nozzles are, and why I prefer the Black nozzles.",">Bass Good quantity and quality. Good texture. Proper balance between sub bass and mid bass for adequate rumble and thump without droning or excessive bloat. Modestly fast bass without undue decay.>Mids Hit-or-miss. It is listenable with decent tonality, but as aforementioned there are tuning choices and coloration which differ from current meta. With the stock Silver nozzles, the elevated presence and overly forward female vocals can be a bit distracting. Less so with the Black nozzles. There is no significant recess or muffling with the Black nozzles, still plenty of midrange clarity.>Treble There is significant roll-off after 10kHz, so this is mainly discussing low and mid treble, handled by dual nozzle BAs. Tuning colorations and implementation come across as cohesive and pleasant, enhancing perception of imaging and details without harsh timbre. There is missing air and ultra high frequencies, so upper harmonic extension is lacking, and more nuanced UHF micro details are not emphasized.>Perceived Technicalities Admirable imaging, layering, and micro details within 10kHz range. Middling separation, macro details, and micro details >10kHz due to upper treble roll-off.>Conclusion Pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but if you find common Chi-Fi offerings lacking low-end oomph, then Quatio is a solid contender. The main warnings are that it does not have meta-tuned upper mids, and I do not think the shell design is good. It remains comfortable for long sessions, no hot spots or outright discomfort, but there is not a lot of leeway for me to achieve proper seal (read as: unforgiving fit, need to find the one correct spot and keep it there). Bland design and mediocre shell ergonomics really diminish the curb appeal and \"beginner recommendation factor,\" but overall accessories and sound are well done to score above average in context of market and price.","Maybe tomorrow I will do some measurements, particularly to check for wideband midrange distortion and validate that they have used the 2DDs to cover most of the frequency response, with the BAs take over beyond 5kHz as they claim.","And as a note for editorzo, I've done this and ddHiFi Surface impressions. Not much else recently. Lots of shit to sift through.","Thanks for the reminder, appreciate the posts!","Kefine Quatio L/R Measurements","THD.

Bass drum hits, bass guitar and low notes on regular guitar are oddly punchy and tactile but the graphs don't show any phase weirdness or distortion. I usually add a sub-bass boost to my pos with EQ but this effect is present even without EQ. I get one peak in the upper treble, and the upper mids are about 3dB too forward for my tastes which makes female vocals slightly shouty/thin. Detail/soundstage/whatever other meme techs are fine, sounds like a good DD which is no surprise. There's no trace of 3H BA distortion. I never got the huge soundstage claims but it has decent stage for a more isolating pos. The cable or rather the modular plug Transjim has cooked up is still the best. The USB C termination is excellent - no hissing/popping/odd behavior - and it has 5 PEQ bands which should be enough for most people. Comfort is top tier despite the size, I don't get any hotspots but I prefer more venting. Overall, I don't think it's an upgrade over the origin. If you don't have either, I'd go with the Force because the accessories are superior and I'd imagine the comfort should also be better for most people, but I still prefer the Origin's regular bass over the weird tactility of the Force.

Process was as follows:>Measure right channel>Measure left channel (match insertion peak)>Measure left channel with EQ turned on>Export right channel measurement as text, use that file as the mic/meter cal file for all three of the above measurements This gives a graph where 0 is the baseline (right channel) and any deviations above or below are the difference in SPL between the left and right channels. I created the EQ profile using measurements of the EP-FX10 tips which is what I normally use with an insertion peak at 9K, so we can see if the EQ created for those tips is applicable to other tips and insertion depths. The results here are promising but inconclusive because the channel balance of my Q1Pro isn't totally horrible so a lot of the changes especially in the air region come down to my ability to match insertion peaks down to the Hz. Also, I was only able to measure insertion peaks between 8K-9K (medium stock tips shallow insert and deep insert graphs, all other tips were in between the two) because I don't have a jig to fix the IEM in place. Conclusions might change for insertion depths that deviate from I was able to measure. What we can see is that up until around 8K, using EQ to correct channel balance pretty much works as expected across all insertion depths and tips. You can see in the last graph that all traces stay within 0.5dB up until that 8K point. Another thing I was curious about was confirming the effect on phase but there were no surprises here - using EQ to match the channels also helped with phase matching. I'll probably try this again later with something that has really bad channel matching and requires high Q filters like my ND Audio Planet, that may provide more clarity.

Been using them for almost a week now. Overall I'd say they sound FINE out of the box but very dark. Cymbals were much quieter than what I'd expect Compared them to thread's favorite (lol) Q1 Pro via sine swipes. They sounded basically like they graph<= Not much difference until 3k (if it's there it's like 1 dB and I was too lazy to actually sit there and sine rape my ears to hear it). Around 4k everything shifted to Q1's side (not surprisingly) Adding 4 dB treble shelf to wyverns immediately made them sound much better, less muffled and closed in. Added 2 dB bass too. I feel like Wyverns despite almost graphing the same have better bass? I can feel it more and not only just punch. It's weird. The biggest con for me is their fit. I guess I discovered that my ear canals need that strong nozzle angle Q1s have. I need to put wyverns in at an angle to make them fit. Also I rolled literally ALL my tips and only decent ones were med sancai (still meh), large spring tips (actually decent but with caveats) and dunu s&s I just got (can reiterate what other people said about them - very good seal but comfort is not as good.)","But actually the biggest difference between the two is imaging and soundstage. I started hearing it in wyverns already with music, soundstage felt wider compared to what I've been used to. But it became very obvious when I launched apex. I didn't even play the game I just jumped into a shooting range. It has target bots running left and right for practice. In Q1 you can just hear steps either in right or left ear there's no real sense of where they are. In Wyverns I immediately could tell that bots are walking in front of me. I could hear where they are easily vs q1 where you can't hear position of the steps AT ALL. Funny enough something like EDC Pro also has a better imaging than Q1 Pro but I don't really use them because of the fit.","So yeah if there are any EQ enthusiasts who can tell me how to EQ soundstage into Q1 Pro feel free to (EQ manipulations I tried did nothing to imaging or soundstage) Forgot to add - wyverns are very nice looking pos.

Also you lose a lot of subbass. Pointless.",">Tanchjim Origin Tested on Nicehck07s – Nice vocal centric set. Kinda enjoyable mid-bass. But incredibly tizzy/splashy treble without proper decay. Cymbal snares sound glassy. The treble timbre is distracting and fucks with the overall tonality of the set. For example, in Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga, there’s a 4-beat drum loop at around the 1-minute mark: the tizzy treble on the Origin (and slow bass) causes the 4-beat to sound only like 2 hits. Swapping to EBT EarrBonds for deeper insertion doesn’t resolve this issue.","28-13/06/2025","Better midrange tonality than the Moondrop Harmon. Now bearing in mind the Cristales is a very colored set, the squig doesn’t show how intense the bass really is. It’s like the Hype 4/Tea Pro on steroids.","Classic Tube mode makes for a very V-shape coloration - boosted midbass and more pinna which pulls female vocals closer. It's okay but I feel the iBasso AMP16 card does this tube coloration better. The RU9 introduces these higher order harmonics in an unnatural way. Meanwhile the Cayin C9 II and Luxury & Precision EA4 makes it sound effortless.","Despite being a harman set, female vocals don’t particularly sound good due to the edgy treble masking finer details in the vocals. Using narrow bore tips helped to add body back to the mids but now the treble sounds even more splashy.","I would buy this.

They sound nice for buds you'd wear when fucking around in the garden, wrenching on your car, cooking or whatever. They get shat on by my more expensive gear that's more focused on critical listening but the blocks really aren't made for this kind of thing. Somehow they do have some bass, it really doesn't go that low but it's there, vocals and most instruments come out nice but they lack a bit in the high highs, then again they're just little speakers that hang in your ears so I'm pleasantly surprised. Fit is a bit weird, maybe I'm just not used to non-iems, you need to get the angle just right or sound quality suffers, it's easy enough to do but you can't just shove them in your ears. They feel a bit unstable in your ears but I couldn't get them to fall off no matter what I did. Touch controls are ok, they work. Latency is pretty low and good enough for videos and movies, I haven't tried gaming with them. I'm torn on the case, it's super small and looks good, it not having a lid is a non-issue for me, but it's made of the shittiest, softest plastic known to man.

Long-term I’m getting a better amp and relegating the Questyle to DAC duty.- Gain switch: Why did Questyle put that shit at the bottom? Also, you can’t change the gain while the unit is switched on.

I'm glad I didn't get the DSP version because I like the stock tuning.","I might buy the ED9 Pro to measure it, but the detachable cable is turning me off.","It's almost $10 cheaper than the One, so probably not a bad idea. It would be a better buy if Amazon had it. I have a lot of faith in the One's cable not breaking, but the area around the plug does not look well protected.","For \"bullet\" IEMs the cable joint thing can be a killer. They may have fixed that, since the old ED9s were already broken by this point. It's really like a 10 year old design IEM, but the tonality is improved. They are both pretty balanced sound wise, but after using the correct tips the ED9 probably still has a bit more bass than the One. I like the One's tonality better but at higher frequencies they are pretty much the same."]},{"l":"Driver Compression (Expansion) Measurements","p":["1k SPL calibrated, last time I calibrated was around a month ago but from my experience there isn't much drifting.

If you're talking about the small boost across the whole frequency range, then theoretically yes it should increase as long as you increase the insertion depth.

The increase in SPL across the whole frequency range is very minimal even when changing the insertion depth by +3 kHz (we're talking about 2.5 dB at best), and if you consider the minimal effect on bass for front vented IEMs, the explanation is in my opinion not substantiated enough to explain the much higher bass boosts that we see in many targets.

All of these lose out to $20 iems in every category except openness/\"soundstage\". I wouldn't recommend buds unless you know what you want but Vidos were okay for the price before they became $500 each w/ Cheeto Benito's tariffs.

Immediately I can tell not only are the lower mids filled but there’s an even bigger glide into the bass. Visceral, guttural bass. But still not overblown.

I think on the surface that stinky motherflipping BASS of gateymotics may mask some minor details but then I still feel like I hear everything gently and effortlessly dancing in the background.

Hey flangebro, after that one anon recently tried gate + triple flange tips and found its upper mids too forward, I played around with eq and tone generator with my gateymotics, and set 4.4 kHz, 2.2 Q, -2 to -4 dB. That kind of fixes the issue with the upper mids. You might want to try that, would be interesting to hear your impressions.","Also, don't get discouraged by these people here, see picrel.","I’ll definitely try to experiment with EQ when I get the chance. I think the “closer” sound is due to the tuning with upper mids yes but also because the sound physically closer to the ear too. The fullness of the lower mids makes it not sound shouty but i am curious what EQ will do this thing is basically flat so an amazing platform for wideband I don’t have access to EQ right now but I assume if I lower the upper mids it might make the bass a bit TOO smelly and dark. So I’d probably have to tone that back down a tad.

The stock tuning is, to me, a bass- and upper-mid-boosted sound. There is nothing wrong with it, it's just not my preference.","Previous anon here, I was using the wrong size tip. The mediums are wider bore and only differ from the smalls in bore diameter and stem length. The issues I brought up before are not as present with the medium tips but I still prefer the stock sound. The EQ filter does help a lot but its still just missing that bit of treble spice. Anyways, here's some graphs for you guys, I support your struggle.","What is going on here and where are these measurements from? This is very nice to have. These measurements seem to confirm the increased bass and mids compared to stock tips that anon described in his hand-drawn graphs. Also, it confirms what I heard in the tone-generator: A peak around 4 kHz. What is the EQ used here for the bright line? This looks like -4 dB at 4.1 kHz, pretty close to what I use. Everything above 5 kHz confuses me, but below 5 kHz it's pretty much how we flangezos said it sounds like.","really interesting graphs…does anyone have that other anon’s graphs that showed gate with different insertion depths? it basically showed the treble being smoother and smoother the deeper the fit went. I’ll have to go back and try to see if I determine that 4khz on a sine wave sweep or something if it’s really bumped up that much it should be easy to tell and perceptually should be like 7db louder than 3khz. As for the bass some other anon said it changes but I doubt a 711 coupler can perceive the changes. 711s always overestimate bass because of the cavity size being much larger than a human ear.

Measurements and impressions coming soon.","Cable doesn't really match but it's fine for now.","Not much to say when it comes to first impressions. Sound quality is actually normal. Bass is there, although subbass isn't really prominent; the bass that is present is actually very good. Mids also sound decent for the most part. There's immediately a noticeable treble peak somewhere that is making everything very sharp and borderline sibilant no matter what instrument. Comfort is good, the fit is snug and isolation is also great. I'll probably compare with the Tiandirenhe that I covered a while back, because both share the same shape and fit (at least 95% the same).","I don't even know where to start with the measurements, but here I go... First is the channel matching, which is pretty good here. I don't really notice the small deviations seen above 5khz. It certainly isn't bothersome.","Next is the insertion depth measurements. If there's something you should remember from this review, it's this particular graph. It is immediately obvious that the resonance that will occur in your ear will vary depending on insertion depth, which is a fact most seem to know. However, the resonance here has a very large bandwidth compared to most other sets, especially when comparing the shallowest and deepest measurements. The resonance is absolutely massive both in range and amplitude, and indicates very low to no damping. Reminder that measurements were done on \"normal\" bore silicone tips of varying lengths/sizes. What is also interesting to note is the sharp decrease near 18-19khz, mainly with the deepest (red) curve where a second resonance is not present.","Finally, here is the full distortion profile of the MagicOne at 86, 94, and 104db (going down, with +/-5db). As expected, 3rd HD is very present, at least for relatively low volume testing. What is interesting here is the \"dominance\" of 2nd HD at higher and higher volume. I have to repeat this again and again; for my listening volume, distortion will never be an issue. The same story applies here, especially when considering the isolation that this provides. While the measurement at 86db isn't great by any standard, it is still way below the threshold of audibility (probably).","So final thoughts, I think it looks very cool, the fit is good, the isolation is excellent, and the sound is actually decent stock. However, when compared to my Tiandirenhe which offers the same type of build quality and isolation, the differences between the both of them is very small after EQ. If only fit and isolation is important, I say get the Tiandirenhe, which is very cheap and has less pressure build up."]},{"l":"Tip Degradation","p":["10/03/2025","Shivers down my spine...","One of the ear tips that came with the Zero Red started to disintegrate after less than two months of light use.

I did encounter used Spring Tips (oily and wider bore) falling off when removing the IEMs. For tips with tighter friction grip like the stock tips, it should be a non-issue. 5.5mm nozzle diameter is good.>Cable>Pros Low profile 3.5/4.4 swappable termination with threaded screw lock, quality conductors, lightweight.>Cons\\Too stiff, springy, and retains memory. A hassle to manage. Pin design meant for recessed slot for a flush 2-pin IEM. Low profile plug can be awkward to grip when plugging in/out.","Other Accessories 2x identical SML sets of black core 07 tips. Nice puck case.>Sound I listened with stock cable 4.4 and M stock tips, but later settled on Juzear Limpid 4.4 and M BGVP W01 tips. Moderate sensitivity. Deep sub bass has presence, but not intense or domineering. Mid bass through lower mids is full bodied with engaging kick. This fullness can sound a bit thick or bloomed at times. Upper mids are prominent. Older mastering such as classical or American pop / rock have good instrument articulation and even-keeled male and female vocals. Modern production with female vocals sounds forward, and louder volume increases how close vocals feel. Rides a line for female poison. Mids timbre is good but not stellar. Upper treble has distinct granular shimmer and tizzy-ness of micro planars. It may be novelty, but I think they have an interesting sound compared to BAs. Reigned in amplitude, treble details are not forcibly pushed, but there is good agility and extension into ultra high frequencies. Better tweeters than low quality BAs, but short of top-tier authentic timbre when critically listening to percussion instruments. Full frequency layering and macro details are strong, while imaging, separation, and micro details are adequate. Good perception of depth, but nothing extraordinary about height or width. The drivers are well-matched, slightly fast without undue decay. Overall, P50 is a solid entrant in the meta pos race, with a slightly bright and vivid tilt. At low-mid volume P50 does well to sound musical and correct, never lacking or flat. A balanced, genre fluid sound signature. At higher volume, some female vocals can step out as overly frontal.","no measurements?","I didn't get around to graphing it yet or AB comparisons. I can if anyone specifically wants. Suffice to say my impressions were settled on in the first few days and have not waned. Some other sets which may graph similar like Kiwi Ears Quintet or Truthear Hexa, I never liked for numerous reasons, and P50 is more pleasant to listen to across the spectrum for me. If I had to place it among current market, it does well as a cheaper Mangird Tea Pro, though the Tea Pro has more powerful overall bass presence. Both present a balance of fuller lower mids with vivid clarity of upper mids through mid treble, and admirable technicalities for their price points.","just wanted to see the unit variation and channel matching mostly also curious about the fit, and i know its semi custom, but how much of it protrudes out?","Very good channel matching as expected, I heard nothing amiss.","Regarding fit, it's always tricky to say because there is a whole spectrum of shell shapes, but it is medium size, and fairly opinionated.

This was back when I didn't do my usual measurements.","Non-sound impressions: Built beautifully. I just love the way it looks with the logo. The Oxygen is similar, but lacks the refinement; the slight border that accentuates the shell shape, the angel logo without the lettering, the slight embossing against the gray face, everything adds up to what is in my opinion the best mirror finished IEM >I've seen in a while. The packaging is fine like what others have said. A bulky yet high quality case, excellent T-APB tips, useless nozzles that have modding potential, and a somewhat lackluster cable in that it behaves like custom cable without having the feel and weight of one. I switched mine out for a custom gray-ish cable that matches the stainless metal and look. The fit is fine. These things are seriously tiny, I thought they would be a bigger Oxygen/Hana in both thickness and shell size, but it seems like only the former is true. The faceplate/body is still really small, and the fit with the extended nozzle and thickness is much better than that of the Oxygen/Hana in my experience. It's not the most secure or custom molded experience, but it works.","First impressions: Bass is definitely the weakest link. It's present, it's good, but on certain tracks it lacks volume. Every bass instrument/track is present, but it's almost always never the center focus. The mids and treble are great. It's essentially a perfected female poison tuning; really vocal forward that skirts the line between being too bright/shouty and being \"revealing\". Overall, in terms of tonal balance, it's pretty great. Most impressive is the treble quality, they somehow managed to make 1DD that imo needs very little to no tweaking for my ears.","Techs and dreams: Overall, it's really tech-y for a 1DD. Soundstage is surprising; usually, a tuning quirk in FR is used to enhance soundstage. An example would be killing the upper midrange on the andromedas, or elevating the treble on many other sets. In my experience, I rarely notice this change in soundstage, and instead the flawed timbre is what pops out. For the Origin, the mix of very separated midrange and bass, with non-peaky yet still elevated treble creates a sense of soundstage that is subtle but noticeable. I don't think this effect is going to stay consistent or even be present for long after my brain gets used to it. The imaging is just like any other IEM, but the enhanced soundstage makes it seem like everything is more separated, leading to a seemingly more focused sound presentation. Bass techs are where I find them to be the most complicated to connect with FR. Soundstage and imaging become similar for different sets if I EQ them to proper timbre, but techs related to bass often requires much more effort to remediate. The Origin has very low bass, but using EQ is effective and requires little fiddling to get to good levels for genres that need it.","Ok final Origins impressions: It's great. Doing this type of very mid/treble forward signature is very hard because it has to be balanced. Many sets try to boost that 3-8khz region because this leads to usually leads to more clarity, but very few manage to make it work with good treble like the Origin does. And the treble is really good to my ears, to the point where I'm not even remotely tempted to use EQ. I don't really know of any other 1DD that is this clean, energetic, and competent in what it sets out to do. I still think the bass is a bit lacking. A small cut at 250hz with a shelf at 125 seems to round out everything, but I only use this for hip hop and rap. Most other genres fare just as, if not better with the stock tuning where the bloat compensates for the forward mids.","based Orijimmy.

It should come down to preference in terms of IEM stability and if you like filling your outer ear or not. They are as perfect as it can possibly get.","Build quality: Both are resin shells, they're good enough. The Q5 Pro is, in my opinion, not a looker, but it's not bad. The Q1 Pro is amazing, beautiful faceplate proportions and design.","Accessories: Q1 Pro is standard, the cable is actually above average as far as stock cables go. Not really pliable, but the kinks can be worked out fairly well. The Q5 Pro's cable is atrocious, feels as stiff as old Tanchjim cables, unusable.

Bright leaning, but there's at least an acceptable amount of bass, though not nearly enough for my taste. No immediate treble issues, but as always it could use some polishing.

There's a reason male vocals are so subdued, thinned out and lacking the necessary heft in Shartman-tuned pos. There are ways to make female vocals really shine without emasculating male vocals in such way, so why? The real aim of the Shartman target was to enhance vocals of troons. It's really simple: troons have unmistakably male voices, but they're trying hard to sound more female and escape what in their twisted minds is stigma and unfortunate fate, but their male vocal cords will always get in the way and reveal who they really are. That's why the Shartman target, which aimed to be another neutral diffuse field but developer further to add room-specific characteristics to the sound, has since strayed from the path of neutrality and, under the guise of being a target preferred by the general population, became a target which makes female vocals sound prominent and bright while performing castration on male vocals. Think of it: it's the logical way to rob tranny vocals from manly heft and emphasize the feminine shine troons try to obtain. The way the Shartman target executes it is with a deep, slightly recessed tuck in the midbass (often called \"tranny tuck\" here) to take from the depth and weight, while emphasizing 5kHz shrill to add upper harmonics that are much necessary to enhance femininity of vocals.

It can vibrate down to 1hz on a tone generator if I raise the volume, so maybe it's fixable with EQ. I thought the 10dB pinna gain was going to hurt me but it only gives some bite to guitars. Like the tryout anon said, the midbass is a little muddy and some vocals can sound veiled despite the pinna gain. It's song dependent.","That said, this IEM does give the feeling of \"soundstage\". It doesn't expand past your head or anything. What I mean is there is some extra space between instruments when they're being played at the same time. Some hybrid IEMs like the P7 have good layering but they just blast everything to your ears and it's overwhelming. The positional imaging is good for games. One thing I hated about the P7 was that panning sounds would quickly snap from one side to the other and barely touch the center. The Volume S does it normally I guess. Since the EPZ P50 graphs like the Volume S but has planars like the P7 I wonder if it has this same issue.","Everybody is sucking off volume S so much but if it fucks up female vocals it's a dealbreaker for me...

There's decent imaging to the point your inner eye can almost see how an instrument is played.*The instrument separation is great; you can single out one as easily as a thread in fabric and follow it as the song goes on.*The detail retrieval is pretty nice; I've discovered new sounds in relatively familiar tracks (e.g., that background jingle in We Drift Like Worried Fire at around 4:50).*The bass is textured and full-bodied but very lively and dynamic, also punchy when it needs to be. It extends beyond the soundstage, adding a lot to the atmosphere, and is definitely the highlight of this IEM.*The vocals feel intimate and natural (note to myself: try listening to some ASMR), and the mids are pretty clean overall.*The treble is crisp but can be very shouty (esp. in games) to the point I'll have to use EQ. What the fuck were they thinking?*The channel imbalance is there. That pestering thought that you might be going deaf won't leave your mind once you've noticed it, even if you know about the imbalance. The build and comfort are where my biggest disappointment comes from. The build is standard, but no attempt was made to make it slightly more ergonomic. The nozzles are huge, almost as huge as the pain in the ass you experience looking for the right eartips. At least the nozzles have lips. The cable is thick and seems durable, but it's fairly heavy and pulls on your ears, making this IEM rather uncomfortable and even painful to wear for prolonged periods of time. Also, at one point, I started to feel tingling at what seemed to be the exact points BC holes made contact with my skin. Well, I suppose it proves that bone conduction works. Is it worth it?

As for measurements, these were taken fresh out of the box, so no filter clogging or other issues should be present. Either the driver is different, which would explain the shift in resonant frequency between the two samples, or the filters are different enough to warrant this change. Does this matter? Not really, the difference is relatively high-Q and small enough as to where I doubt most people will notice it. This silent revision is arguably quite harmless, and I still hold these very highly as per my previous review of them.

Taking the dongle out and plugging it back in fixes the issue, but it is quite annoying. I'm not sure if this is a common issue or specific to my device, however I did check the legitimacy online with the QR code it came with so at least I can say that it's a legit dongle causing these issues. I also know that it's an issue with the dongle because my JM30 dongle doesn't have these issues.

The most common thought i have when switching between them is that the resolution just keeps getting better but they all sound relatively similar. None of them sound particularly bad, but you notice an increase in sound stage with every step up you do. The cool thing about the ignite x too is that they're shaped exactly like the wyverns so the comfort is 1:1. Ignite X could basically be seen as upgraded wyverns. The Plutus sound almost identical, but are the only ones shaped weird because of the BC driver. and man that BC driver makes bass fucking 3d. plutus still mogs but as far as tuning goes, all 3 are right up my alley.","If I were on a strict 50 dollar budget and couldn't go higher, the ignite x feels perfect.

Well built shells, fit is uncommonly decent for planar. Modest sensitivity, not hard to drive. Joins my top 3 planars (other two being OG P1 MAX and T10), edging out S12 Pro. S12 Pro too hot 6-12kHz and has usual wonky planar mids transition (i.e. early 2kHz peak and odd damping dip). P20 has more typical pinna gain resulting in appropriate female vocal timbre, balanced with warm thumpy bass and good treble extension.",">Aoshida E20 Decent case and cable. Well built shells, I never like unfinished 3-D print resin though. Shells are fairly small but aren't particularly ergonomic, so fit is just OK. Specs suggest less sensitive than most IEMs, and it is indeed the case. Surprisingly pleasant sound. I say that because I usually don't like tucked bass. Mid bass and lower mids still have enough body for my liking, and the general pros of Harman-like tuning are there, engaging sub bass and upper mids prominence. Can be a tad bright with the presence ~ 5kHz, but nothing offensive.>+80ohm adapter Good bassy fun and part of why I redeemed it. Still a realistic and listenable sound. In that regard, water-cooler talk and comparison to Deuce is apt. (I demo'd Deuce previously, not an AB comparison) The main difference is as graphs suggest, E20 has more prominence 5kHz upwards arguably better balancing appropriate amount of clarity to overcome high bass levels.

Upper mids and female vocals are centered but take a step back in bassier tracks. Uppermost treble rolls off naturally, a comfortable treble level. Most suitable if someone is prioritizing prominent mid bass thump / lower octave instrument articulation with balanced male and female vocals and safe treble.

Port orientation is irrelevant to me but some audiotards get their panties in a bunch over it. M1 Plus is microSD and USB-C on bottom, 3.5 + 4.4 on top. Fairly happy with the OS and UI/UX. Intuitive and simple, customization is done in a few minutes in only a few sub-menus. CPU is fast enough to react quickly, but touch accuracy can be a bit imprecise at times compared to modern flagship operation. Not a great display in terms of color or refresh rate, but serviceable in the context of entry-level DAP.>Annoyances: Battery is an approximate visualizer, I don't see an option to enable numerical %. Also can't predict or see how close it is to full charge. Infinite scrolling track info.

The tuning is definitely more approachable with the extra bass and treble, but I wouldn't really recommend them as beginner IEM's due to the aforementioned misguided choice of materials and issues caused by it.","The EPZ Q1 Pro's on the other hand don't have removable filters and I do worry about how they'll fare with the inevitable clog, but them being made out of resin and having a more extruded nozzle do make a major difference in the fit and comfort, they don't fall out like the Chu 2's and the stock tips are perfectly fine. The Harman tuning is definitely flatter, but it's nothing a little 200Hz low pass shelf can't fix if you want that extra bass, your ears get used to the stock tuning anyways.

They're so grippy and soft that at the first insertion they grip to your ears, then you just bend them around the mounting ring instead of pushing them further. You have to let go, let them get back to the original shape, push in again, and essentially knead them in for a bit and then they're perfectly fitted. A bit more finicky but it's not too bad. They don't seem to suffer from \"wet ear\" that much where my ear moisture starts making them slippery and overly noisy, they isolate sound from the outside much like any stock tips, and the deeper fit/wider bore actually give it more bass which is good to have.

Here's a quick rewrite.","To whoever rec'd that thing like 2 weeks ago, thank you it's great. For anyone looking for a dongle to use with an app or device that doesn't support software EQ like Netflix or something, this thing works. You get 5 bands PEQ, gain range of -12dB to 12dB, quality range of 0.25q to 8.0q, and you get peak, hsq, and lsq filters. There's also a gain slider. If you need the entire 24dB range to fix something with EQ this thing probably isn't powerful enough to drive it unless they're very easy to drive IEMs, since I had to crank to 80% on my phone with -12dB on 64Ohm earbuds (don't know the sensitivity). It can be challenging to make a good EQ preset with 5 bands, but it's better than no EQ and for 15 euros that's all I can ask for.","same happened to me. ctrl+c before you post anything longer i guess... good review thx","I usually do, but forgot this time. Oh well.","What's up with their janky ass firmware, what are the fixes doing. Is the web version of the configurator still broken. I'm not following closely since I already have system-wide EQ everywhere I need and my dongle is more powerful.","I didn't even know they had a web version of the configurator, but I've gotten it set up now using the app and I don't feel like checking it out rn. Yeah the app kinda sucks, but once you have the EQ set you don't really need to anymore so I don't really care. Some things I noticed are that when you upload the EQ to the dongle it cuts out the audio and you have to start whatever you were listening to back up. Also I'm not entirely certain but I think there is a difference in sound before and after uploading the preset to the dongle despite the PEQ GUI clearly being live. I also have system-wide EQ on my phone and PC and I have a JM30 that I really enjoy, however unlike Spotify the Netflix app can't be cracked to allow audio recordings which breaks my EQ setup on my phone. So far I've noticed that the JM30 gets much louder, but I haven't noticed any noise on the JA11 so far. If I do notice anything weird I'll be sure to come back with an update.","Pro tip, you can save 1 or 2 shelf filters by moving the entire graph to your desired level of bass/treble.","Yeah I did something like that. I first tried to use one 0.25q peak cut to reduce the mids and fix the treble with a shelf which wasn't really all that close to my usual preset. I changed that to two high shelf filters which not only allowed me to have something similar to my usual bass and treble, but also allowed me to get the mids much closer to my target with one less filter than usual. I need the other three bands to fix some peaks and dips in the treble, so I only really have 2 bands to set the general shape."]},{"l":"Anon visits the (Z)Hangout","p":[">64 Audio U12T (with M20 module) A smoother Fei Wan, with less jarring treble peaks.

Tight and detailed bass and boosted treble for techs. Mids sound leaner than it graphs – reminds me of the Monarch MK3. While the Fei Wan is highly resolving, it doesn’t sound cohesive. Not that impressed, I think the U12T and Annihilator do it better, and for way cheaper. 7.5/10.",">Canpur CP622B Mega5EST without the bloat. Actually nice separation. Very inoffensive tuning but I'm not sure about forking out $3500 for the audiophilia equivalent of plain water. Again, there's no real faults with the Canpur, it's just...boring.",">Elysian Acoustics Annihilator 2023 (USD$3000) Lives up to the hype. Extremely clinical and incredibly resolving – TOTL “techs”. Only complaint is that it is TOO clinical – music sounds cold and there’s no sub-bass thump. But minor flaw like this can be forgiven when the upside is so great. You WILL believe in “techs” once you hear this IEM. 10/10.",">Eminent Ears Ruby Another summit-fi IEM with hot treble. I call this the “class 3 listener” tuning – lesser bass and more crisp and airy treble. Also sacrificing mids for female vocal specialization. Male vocals sound anemic. Joins the likes of the Empire Ears Odin and Aroma Feiwan. Summit-fi manufacturers really love doing this sort of tuning.",">Empire Ears Odin (US$3400) Female vocals have a slight edginess and unnatural extension to them. Suffers from overenergetic treble like the Camelot. But good timbre and very wide-sounding. Lows and mids are okay, if you cope hard enough the Odin is usable. 5/10.",">Fearless x Crinacle Dawn Looks like Crin already did New Meta 4 years ago. This thing is better than the Mega5EST in every way. Better quality bass and more resolving in the uppermids/treble. Subjectively, I would rank the Fearless as 30% better than the M5E.",">Ice Lab Prismatica Obscure pos that nobody talks about. Overly bloaty mid-bass and an aggressive pinna+treble to overcompensate. Not worth the trade-off, it sounds like an unrefined or muddy V-shape with no microdetails. However, there is a certain “fullness” in the midrange compared to your typical Harman, which might entice a specific subset of listeners. Also has quite a tamed treble, so no fear of sibilance I guess. 6/10.",">IOAudio Volare and Sogno SM4 is better than both IOAudio iems. The Volare sounds identical to the SM4 but with poorer techs. Also, the massive shell hurts my delicate earussy. Utter pos. Crin really approved this?",">Melodic Artification Alter Ego (USD$2500) Classic Harman tuning like the SM4 and Truthear Nova. Bass switch adds body and warmth which sounds like New Meta-adjacent. Both tunings are really good without sacrificing resolution. Sounds like a refined Monarch MK3 without its recessed mids. If you think of this as 2 IEMs in 1, the value proposition is not that bad. 9.5/10.",">Nightjar Singularity Incredible bass - detailed and very deep. Timbre is natural and accurate. Female vocals are clean, and plenty of sparkle despite the boosted low-end. However, on certain songs with a constant low-end presence, the bass becomes distracting, as the Singularity gives you a persistent sub-bass rumble which never stops. The bass-heavy tuning also results in a peculiar soundstage: the cello is too close, but the violin is too far. The timpani is too close, but snare drum sounds too far. Piano timbre also varies because low-end keystrokes are too pronounced.",">Nostalgia Audio Camelot (USD$2600) VERY boomy bass and energetic treble. Aggressive V-shape. The Camelot is too shrill and sibilant for me. Mids might as well not exist. 0/10.",">Nostalgia Audio Durandal (USD$2420) Same problem as with the EE Odin. Sibilant, raspy female vocals. Harman-adjacent tuning but barely on the level of the SM4. 2/10.",">Softears RS10 Slightly warm, veiled, and low-res. Maybe the demo unit was broken because this thing doesn’t even sound as good as the Salnotes Zero. It’s akin to hearing an IEM at such low volume that you can’t even begin to describe its sound signature, that’s how I feel when listening to the RS10.",">Softears RSV Twilight but with thumping sub-bass and a bit more added treble. I think the slight V-shape tuning hurts the timbre of the RSV and makes it sound worse than the Twilight. There’s no reason for the RSV to exist because the Twilight is just the clear upgrade in every way and I would pay the extra $200 every time. 6/10.",">Softears Twilight Endgame 1DD for musicality. Warm and intimate sounding without heavy thumping sub-bass. A very smooth and relaxing listen. The bass decay is slow but life-like and natural, and it doesn’t sound muddy at all. In fact, I think it’s more resolving than hybrids like the Mega5EST, V16 Divinity and Xenns Top. Soundstage may be lacking because vocals sound so intimate, but I think that’s more of a pro than a con. 10/10.",">Subjective preference Annihilator > Alter Ego > VE10 > Odin > Durandal > Camelot",">Subjective Ranking Fearless > Supernova > Prestige > RS10",">Subjective ranking Twilight > U12T > Fei Wan > Prismatica > RSV",">Symphonium Crimson Bright detailed treble, and equally detailed bass. However, the Crimson lacks sub-bass slam (because it’s a BA-only set?). The bass is punchy but there’s no physicality to it. Unremarkable mids, with female vocals being slightly recessed to give a sense of wider soundstage. Guitar plucks have that summit-fi extension and detail but low-end instruments (like the tuba) sound lifeless.",">Thieaudio Monarch MK3 50% better than SM4. This is probably what endgame Harman sounds like. V-shape with boosted lows and highs. Kilobuck techs and resolution.",">Thieaudio Origin Didn’t like it. Mids and treble were decent but the BC driver was distracting. Maybe it was poor fit, but I could never predict when the BC driver was going to kick in, so rather than aiding in audio reproduction, it just felt like someone was tickling my ear at random intervals.",">Thieaudio V16 Divinity Infinitely better than SM4. Now this I like a lot. A warmer sounding Monarch MK3, whilst retaining most of its upper mids and treble tech. I’ve always felt that the Mega5EST had perfect timbre but poor resolution and air, and the V16 fixes that. V16 is JM-1 perfected.",">Vision Ears EXT MK2 Punchy bass, detailed treble, recessed mids. An overpriced Monarch MK 2 3.",">Vision Ears VE10 (USD$3030) Aggressive V-shape like the Camelot but done tastefully. Tons of bass and treble without sacrificing mids. The definition of fun. 9/10.",">Xenns Mangird Top 20% better than SM4. Bright sounding, but bass was impactful and detailed. Nicer techs and resolution than SM4.

Samsung K3. Before streaming services, you could legally download music onto this via Napster (which was at that time a legal entity with a subscription plan). The platform had a lot of leverage behind its name so it was able to get vast libraries of any musician's catalogues including rare releases and things.","So I would be walking around in that era carrying ALL the music I wanted to listen to forever, when at the time an album was £10 to download. Didn't have to dig through limewire for the right files or pay big money, just copy+pasted them directly from the artist page into my mp3 player. This was a good 6-8 years before it became normal to own music so easily, or possible to stream it on the go reliably. Curiously if you stopped paying the monthly bill your music would also stop playing, it would check your status every time you charged it.","The design language was also nice, it looks very samsung, and has aged quite well I'd say. Obviously this was before we had touch screens, so this device had a haptic control where you tapped up or down and it inputted the feedback that way, with the screen above.","I just got a rush of nostalgia thinking about it for the first time in so long."]},{"l":"KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review","p":["13/11/2024","KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review Ok I'm going to keep this quite short.","Fit is really good, some of KZ's best since the early semi-customs days way back. It's similar to others like the Libra, but has small tweaks that make it a bit better, such as the dip in the lower part of the shell so that it hooks on to the ear more. Looks are fine, better than usual but far from good looking. At least it's not a QDC connection.","Sound is good and is very similar to the Libra, which for people that read my review should know that it sounded very good especially for the price, but could use some tweaking in the bass. Same thing here, everything is balanced and \"generic\".","Channel matching is relatively disappointing for KZ, and is somewhat noticeable on my end in the midrange. I'm being picky here for this type of release. Distortion (104dB) is decent, but nothing great or even good.","Overall, it's a good set but again, nothing particularly remarkable. Chances are you already have something very similar if you've been in the game for a while. It's a testament to the level of performance you can get at extreme budget prices, but it's hard to get excited.","KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review I also got a DAC with customizable PEQ: 8 peak filters, Q values from 0.1 to 5, gain values from -10.0 to 10.0 dB, and playback volume adjustment (ie preamp). There are 8 built-in presets, and 4 custom ones, although you can modify all of them to your liking (ie 12 customizable presets). The EQ setting saves itself unto the DAC. The EQ values seem accurate enough (correct gain and Q, frequency is a bit imprecise, veering off by a couple of hz). It uses the WalkPlay app where you need to register, so use a throwaway email. It's a CB1200AU DAC chip, so anything with it should work with the app and have EQ capabilities.","The DAC itself is unfortunately noisy. Using it on Android with the default sample rate and bit depth (48/16) results in very prominent noise floor and distortion. Switching to the advertised 32bit results in less noise and no distortion (which I'm assuming is a result of the Android audio stack) but requires much more volume to get to the same output. The noise is not extreme, but it is very noticeable during silence. Normal volume music masks it mostly.","It's a decent device, and is a rather solid EQ option for those on a budget (around $5). Just beware that it has a noise floor that will certainly not suit higher dynamic range music such as classical, or \"low-density\" music (ie acoustical/instrumental tracks, jazz, etc).","Not a bad measuring POS at all really. This or TRN MT5? The latter hasn’t been making any waves but seems pretty decent too albeit generic","Tough question. Both can be had at around the same price right now, so it wholly depends on the looks, comfort, and small yet important differences in sound. KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review Both don't look great, but the very generic and simple look of the MT5 is great if a sleek look is needed. I feel like the bass on the MT5 is better controlled, whereas the EDC Pro is a bit too much and veers into being muddy and slow. There's also the ear gain peak shift, but that's completely up to preference, and isn't all that important (ie not much change).","Comfort on the EDC Pro is better personally because the shell fills my ears better and there's a level of snugness that isn't on the MT5. Also the QDC >>>connection on the MT5 is not ideal for me in terms of cable comfort (not to mention cool third party cables), but I wouldn't buy the KZs if the plan is to use the stock cable.","Durability remains to be seen, but I assume the EDC Pro will last longer considering my Conch suffers pretty badly from condensation-related drops in volume."]},{"l":"TRI I3 MK3, Kinera Celest Relentless, Hisenior Mega5EST Impressions","p":["09/11/2024","TRI I3 MK3, Kinera Celest Relentless, Hisenior Mega5EST Impressions 3 most recent pos: TRI I3 MK3: Good mids-forward tuning.

Depending on your standards, 50% to 66% of units are decent. I understand why crapzo bought a bunch of CRAs, it's the only way to guarantee you get a good pair. Mixing and matching gave me one \"golden\" pair, the left channel from sample 3 and the right channel from sample 6. Other stuff about the IEM, the build is incredibly solid, not just for the price. It's all metal and the comfort is better than every other KZ I've tried. The shell is just as nice as the EA500LM shell, slightly more comfortable and I think it looks better too. The build was the reason I decided to do this experiment, I figured I'd spend about as much as the EA500LM to see if I could get a good pair after the first pair I ordered ended up having not so great channel matching. Sound wise the Saga is decently bassy, with an irritating spike at 11.3K to my ears and slightly muddy lower mids but otherwise not really deficient in any other area. The ear gain and treble are still a few dB too much for my taste but that's a matter of preference. I can't recommend KZ unless you have your own coupler and are willing to buy roll the dice on multiple units to do the QC yourself. The stock cable is also an abomination as expected. This was fun though, and I'm happy with the results."]},{"l":"FatFreq x HBB Deuce","p":["26/10/2024","Deuce...pffft.","FatFreq x HBB Deuce Finally my DEUCE pos had arrived","The most comfy shell I've ever had but the nozzle is weirdly wide for 2dd.

Haven't had any major clogging issues but I'm not confident . Looks nice and plain.","Sound: Surprisingly good. Using tips for deep insertion; treble is relatively smooth, maybe a minor peak here and there. Not missing much in terms of treble information/resolution, but I'll check thoroughly later. This actually reminds me of the Wan'er but with more treble. While bass seems to be more, it is very lacking and needs a sub bass boost to bring back some rumble and body. Channel matching is good (the very small imbalance in sub bass is not really noticeable), distortion is also far from an issue.","Conclusion: It's good, really good. I'm not spending too much time on this because it's just another IEM that performs well, but it is commendable that a well-built, comfortable, and good sounding IEM can be had for around $5. I'm keeping these in my rotation for a while and will update if there's anything new that pops up.","Nice man. looks like it graphs very similar to the orca. I was always on the edge of copping that set…i might do so now it looks better than orca aesthetically","Basically the same looking at other measurements.

First thing I did was change tips. I ended up on something with shallower insertion depth, but with much better seal, which in turn improved the bass drastically; a small sub bass boost is still nice but far from necessary now. The previous tips were very comfortable, but any small jaw movement would ever so slightly break the seal.","As for EQ, I didn't do much, just a very small bump around 10khz just to increase resolution. Everything seems to match my hearing perfectly, I'm rather surprised.","Compared to other 1DD in terms of sound quality, it is excellent to my ears, and I wouldn't be mad if this was the only IEM I could use from now on.","TRN MT5 Review And here are the results from a bit of quick modding. Seems like foams are ideal for that 5khz peak in case it is too prominent on some units. Didn't notice a huge difference there. However, it seems like the front vent is dropping a good amount of bass. Haven't listened to this last one as the vent blocking was due to the coupler pressing against the tip dome/umbrella and covering the vent. Becomes a bit uncontrolled and has some driver flex and pressure issue. Maybe a light filter will work."]},{"l":"Lepic Nuon Clears and Coreir Al Tips Impressions and Measurements","p":["22-23/10/2024","Lepic Nuon Clears and Coreir Al tips impressions and measurements New Japanese tips, got the Lepic (le epic xDD) Nuon Clears and the new Coreir AL.

Don't know if this is common knowledge, but just wanted to let you guys know that whatever filter Tanchjim is using on the 4U (and I'm assuming on most of their other IEMs) is simply a 500 mesh filter. I remeasured since I felt like they had gotten a bit darker with a subtle ear gain shift; lo and behold, it seems like the effects of the filter enhanced themselves (due to uncleanable clogging/condensation?), reducing the ear gain even more. Swapping for a 500 mesh filter, which looks identical apart for the surrounding glue, brought it back to its original tuning. I will however say that I'm keeping the old filters, since the more relaxed tuning fits how I use it (long periods because it's so damn comfortable).

The second group of tips are the W1, Flex, and Ultraclears, and they all graph differently to each other and the first group of tips. I'm surprised to see upper mids being affected, I had always assumed tips really only differed above 10K but these graphs suggest tip choices don't matter at all until they do. The changes below 10K are 1-2dB at most but this might be audible. I'm guessing bore diameter is a significant factor, all 3 'abnormal' tips are narrower bore than all the 'normal' tips and the Flex and W1 have bendy heads.

There is a smoothed over creamy cohesiveness about them, but A6000 does have a surprising perception of openness. They are not sensitive, warm balanced, slightly more techs than any of the E or S bullet series, better sub bass and more typical upper mids tuning.

Most things are going to diverge as far as frequency response in some region or another. JM-1 meta meme and all that, it's fairly uncommon. The EJ07 successor prototype was solid, afaik it will be 1DD+4BA(?)+4EST, with tuning relatively similar to OG EJ07 which is fairly balanced. ETA release early next year. Nightjar Singularity and Duality are both good as far as retaining a natural timbre and presentation, but are definitely more bass-enhanced sets. As far as Thieaudio's stuff, Monarch MKIII and Origin are my \"safe picks,\" from their ~ kilobuck lineup, but they are probably more boosted in the upper mids and treble on average."]},{"l":"Tanchjim 4U Review","p":["27/09/2024","Tanchjim 4U Review Sistas... 4U review coming soon.","Tanchjim 4U Review Tanchjim 4U Impressions/Review","Build quality is excellent as per usual. Nice shell with no sharp edges, very good (albeit thin) cable that behaves very well, good tips that actually fit the large nozzle, and nice little gifts too. Remains to be seen if the reflective faceplate will ever scratch, but after a week and a half, nothing has appeared.","Fit is one of two reasons why I bought this, and it doesn't disappoint. Very nice fitting, and the general size of it allows for very good tip compatibility in terms of comfort and stability. It is a decent bit bigger than the Chu 2, but still much smaller than the average IEM; depending on the tips used, it sits flush inside the ear.","Tanchjim 4U Review(check archive for full resolution) Sound quality","It sounds fine. Not much else to say really, it sounds like any well tuned, competent IEM. The overall tonal balance is very good. Treble is a bit on the spicy side, but nothing major either. Again, not much else to say. Do note that I'm using the stock small wide bore tips, so it is inserted quite deeply.","The other reason I bought this is for the tuning gimmick, which works surprisingly well. Between the most and second most options, the difference is relatively minor. The third most is significantly different than the previous two, and has a very \"earbud\" like presentation. The fourth has the least bass, and is too far gone. The issue with both of these last options is that the amount of lost sub bass is not compensated properly with mid bass like it is with earbuds. For most people, the first three options are the only worthwhile ones in my opinion.","Picrel are the measurements. Distortion is very impressive (no precise values since I haven't calibrated the coupler this time), as well as channel matching: ignore the small difference between channels around 6khz, it is most probably my fault.","Tanchjim 4U Review Finally, for the gazette, a size comparison with the Chu 2.

At higher volumes, S12 2024’s planar timbre is worse than the T10 – cymbals have an unnatural shimmer and wind instruments have a metallic sheen. Also, the S12 2024 is prone to sibilance, so tip-rolling is required. I found DUNU S&S tips to work but foam tips would be better.","Comparisons with Artti T10 S12 2024 sounds a tad cleaner than the T10 but articulation is sometimes sharpened to the point of harshness. Call it “better techs” if you want, but I’d still choose the T10 because it isn’t as sibilant/painful to listen to. Ultimately both planars sound very similar and any difference is just a nitpicking exercise.","Comparisons with Mega5-EST The S12 2024 does sound more detailed than the Mega5est probably since the S12 has a noticeably quicker bass decay which gives it a cleaner midrange and better instrument separation.","New meta IEMs (like the DaVinci, KE4) sound muddy in comparison, but I wouldn’t call the S12 2024 a highly resolving set, since the S12’s excessive \"SH\" and \"S\" energy in female vocals can occasionally overpower the treble and cause higher pitch instruments to sound less detailed (masking the shimmer from cymbals and jingle from the tambourine).","Cons The set is library/track dependent. Poor fit for jpop/kpop. I want to say instrumentals/classical is fine since I liked Vivaldi on the S12 2024, but it’s a genre with high dynamic range so I’ve had tracks cross into the harshness threshold even on low volume.","inb4 planars are not meant for listening at high volume At low volume the S12 2024 is painfully average. But if you crank up the volume to chase “planar techs” you are forced to play a game of tightrope with the volume knob.

Absolutely not a single sound or hissing when nothing is playing or connected. It's built like a tank, very heavy metal frame. Conclusion: absolutely recommended. The Gatos are, unsurprisingly, what you can expect for 20 freedombucks. They are not bad by any metric, and better than pretty much everything else not chink on this price bracket and maybe a little more. The bass is non existent unless you EQ, then it's kinda there. They are on the brighter side in general, lower treble is good, but when you go higher it shits the bed, also hi-hats sound awful. The mids and vocals are okayish, but very straightforward which I personally like. I can't talk about fit because my ear canal is weird and I never had a single in-ear fit in there snuggly.

The energy picks back up for the last few tracks, but not to the degree of the first part. The album is filled with good tracks, but something about the tracklist and flow of it makes it feel clunky and misproportioned."]},{"l":"JACKBOYS 2 - JACKBOYS & Travis Scott (13/07/2025)","p":["13/05/2025","Recycled reheated throwaways from a group of mediocre artists looking to scrape something together despite not having anything new to offer.

It does feel a bit long, and many tracks feel incomplete or not all that standout within the whole project. It is bloated, and I feel like that is a part of its charm as a throwback to old mixtapes. Just have to take the songs I liked and make my own cassette :p"]},{"l":"Saisons - Alice Hebborn (06/12/2025)","p":["07/03/2025 Loved the instrumentation on this, cool and relaxing textures that are still engaging.

It is rather polarizing, but I'm in love with it. Favorite part is the whole sequence from God Made You A Monster to Killing Over Likes which covers all of the previous points and more.","It's good, closer to Skeletrix Language in terms of production and musical form. Feels more fleshed out and out there in terms of experimentation. Favorite track is Real One, great production and vocal inflection variety here."]},{"l":"The New Sound - Geordie Greep (04/10/2024)","p":["08/10/2024","The New Sound - Geordie Greep Only some real music.

Don't normally listen to pop but this was surprisingly not terrible. The songs are different enough to keep it engaging but stay on theme. Album is Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay.>She Looked Like Me Probably the worst song of the album. That overbaring bass thump at ~ 055 and another time towards the end just ruins it for me.>Killing Time The song that prompted a review. Superb opening, should have been the opening track. Would have been nice if they kept the energy going but instead it goes into true blue interlude.>Death and Romance Stereotypical repetitive pop song. Album certainly picks up after here though with some bangers. I think they should have just dropped tracks 1 and 3-5 and had a normal length album with all around decent tracks. The lyrics aren't particularly inspiring and the vocalist (at least in this album) has the range of a teaspoon so they would have to do something reasonably different in their other albums to keep me interested (first time listening to them). Also the music is nice but most tracks don't really have the depth that would keep me listening when I'm not preoccupied. There was one track near the start that needs crossfeed on IEMs, I can't remember which one though and the infringement isn't present in any other songs."]}],[{"l":"IEMGallery","p":["A collection of the hottest, weirdest, repulsive, intriguing, mythical, and influential IEMs. Only pics with singular IEMs are included."]}],[{"l":"Board Migration","p":["Talk about timing.
