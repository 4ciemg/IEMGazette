The treble sounds well tuned but there’s some small peaks and dips in there, >probably around the resonance peak around 7khz.>gateymotics That. Stupid. Bass. Immediately I can tell not only are the lower mids filled but there’s an even bigger glide into the bass. Visceral, guttural bass. But still not overblown.

I think on the surface that stinky motherflipping BASS of gateymotics may mask some minor details but then I still feel like I hear everything gently and effortlessly dancing in the background. Zero reds tuning gives it an advantage here but I feel like it has less zing and pop which gives it less imaging and separation.

Hey flangebro, after that one anon recently tried gate + triple flange tips and found its upper mids too forward, I played around with eq and tone generator with my gateymotics, and set 4.4 kHz, 2.2 Q, -2 to -4 dB. That kind of fixes the issue with the upper mids. You might want to try that, would be interesting to hear your impressions.","Also, don't get discouraged by these people here, see picrel.","I’ll definitely try to experiment with EQ when I get the chance. I think the “closer” sound is due to the tuning with upper mids yes but also because the sound physically closer to the ear too. The fullness of the lower mids makes it not sound shouty but i am curious what EQ will do this thing is basically flat so an amazing platform for wideband I don’t have access to EQ right now but I assume if I lower the upper mids it might make the bass a bit TOO smelly and dark. So I’d probably have to tone that back down a tad. If this was shallow insertion tips you’re 100% right take a decent chunk out of that 2-5khz range and everything else should line up(sans resonances and upper treble)",">if I lower the upper mids it might make the bass a bit TOO smelly and dark Exactly how I perceive it, this is why I use a lowshelf filter to fix the bass, in addition to the upper-mid-cut: Filter 1: ON LSC Fc 100 Hz Gain -6.0 dB Q 0.5 Filter 2: ON PK Fc 4400 Hz Gain -4.0 dB Q 2.2 To me, this is a neutral sound, aka my preference. The stock tuning is, to me, a bass- and upper-mid-boosted sound. There is nothing wrong with it, it's just not my preference.","Previous anon here, I was using the wrong size tip. The mediums are wider bore and only differ from the smalls in bore diameter and stem length. The issues I brought up before are not as present with the medium tips but I still prefer the stock sound. The EQ filter does help a lot but its still just missing that bit of treble spice. Anyways, here's some graphs for you guys, I support your struggle.","What is going on here and where are these measurements from? This is very nice to have. These measurements seem to confirm the increased bass and mids compared to stock tips that anon described in his hand-drawn graphs. Also, it confirms what I heard in the tone-generator: A peak around 4 kHz. What is the EQ used here for the bright line? This looks like -4 dB at 4.1 kHz, pretty close to what I use. Everything above 5 kHz confuses me, but below 5 kHz it's pretty much how we flangezos said it sounds like.","really interesting graphs…does anyone have that other anon’s graphs that showed gate with different insertion depths? it basically showed the treble being smoother and smoother the deeper the fit went. I’ll have to go back and try to see if I determine that 4khz on a sine wave sweep or something if it’s really bumped up that much it should be easy to tell and perceptually should be like 7db louder than 3khz. As for the bass some other anon said it changes but I doubt a 711 coupler can perceive the changes. 711s always overestimate bass because of the cavity size being much larger than a human ear. I think Resolve explained it pretty well.

Measurements and impressions coming soon.","Cable doesn't really match but it's fine for now.","Not much to say when it comes to first impressions. Sound quality is actually normal. Bass is there, although subbass isn't really prominent; the bass that is present is actually very good. Mids also sound decent for the most part. There's immediately a noticeable treble peak somewhere that is making everything very sharp and borderline sibilant no matter what instrument. Comfort is good, the fit is snug and isolation is also great. I'll probably compare with the Tiandirenhe that I covered a while back, because both share the same shape and fit (at least 95% the same).","I don't even know where to start with the measurements, but here I go... First is the channel matching, which is pretty good here. I don't really notice the small deviations seen above 5khz. It certainly isn't bothersome.","Next is the insertion depth measurements. If there's something you should remember from this review, it's this particular graph. It is immediately obvious that the resonance that will occur in your ear will vary depending on insertion depth, which is a fact most seem to know. However, the resonance here has a very large bandwidth compared to most other sets, especially when comparing the shallowest and deepest measurements. The resonance is absolutely massive both in range and amplitude, and indicates very low to no damping. Reminder that measurements were done on \"normal\" bore silicone tips of varying lengths/sizes. What is also interesting to note is the sharp decrease near 18-19khz, mainly with the deepest (red) curve where a second resonance is not present.","Finally, here is the full distortion profile of the MagicOne at 86, 94, and 104db (going down, with +/-5db). As expected, 3rd HD is very present, at least for relatively low volume testing. What is interesting here is the \"dominance\" of 2nd HD at higher and higher volume. I have to repeat this again and again; for my listening volume, distortion will never be an issue. The same story applies here, especially when considering the isolation that this provides. While the measurement at 86db isn't great by any standard, it is still way below the threshold of audibility (probably).","So final thoughts, I think it looks very cool, the fit is good, the isolation is excellent, and the sound is actually decent stock. However, when compared to my Tiandirenhe which offers the same type of build quality and isolation, the differences between the both of them is very small after EQ. If only fit and isolation is important, I say get the Tiandirenhe, which is very cheap and has less pressure build up."]},{"l":"Tip Degradation","p":["10/03/2025","Shivers down my spine...","One of the ear tips that came with the Zero Red started to disintegrate after less than two months of light use.

A hassle to manage. Pin design meant for recessed slot for a flush 2-pin IEM. Low profile plug can be awkward to grip when plugging in/out.","Other Accessories 2x identical SML sets of black core 07 tips. Nice puck case.>Sound I listened with stock cable 4.4 and M stock tips, but later settled on Juzear Limpid 4.4 and M BGVP W01 tips. Moderate sensitivity. Deep sub bass has presence, but not intense or domineering. Mid bass through lower mids is full bodied with engaging kick. This fullness can sound a bit thick or bloomed at times. Upper mids are prominent. Older mastering such as classical or American pop / rock have good instrument articulation and even-keeled male and female vocals. Modern production with female vocals sounds forward, and louder volume increases how close vocals feel. Rides a line for female poison. Mids timbre is good but not stellar. Upper treble has distinct granular shimmer and tizzy-ness of micro planars. It may be novelty, but I think they have an interesting sound compared to BAs. Reigned in amplitude, treble details are not forcibly pushed, but there is good agility and extension into ultra high frequencies. Better tweeters than low quality BAs, but short of top-tier authentic timbre when critically listening to percussion instruments. Full frequency layering and macro details are strong, while imaging, separation, and micro details are adequate. Good perception of depth, but nothing extraordinary about height or width. The drivers are well-matched, slightly fast without undue decay. Overall, P50 is a solid entrant in the meta pos race, with a slightly bright and vivid tilt. At low-mid volume P50 does well to sound musical and correct, never lacking or flat. A balanced, genre fluid sound signature. At higher volume, some female vocals can step out as overly frontal.","no measurements?","I didn't get around to graphing it yet or AB comparisons. I can if anyone specifically wants. Suffice to say my impressions were settled on in the first few days and have not waned. Some other sets which may graph similar like Kiwi Ears Quintet or Truthear Hexa, I never liked for numerous reasons, and P50 is more pleasant to listen to across the spectrum for me. If I had to place it among current market, it does well as a cheaper Mangird Tea Pro, though the Tea Pro has more powerful overall bass presence. Both present a balance of fuller lower mids with vivid clarity of upper mids through mid treble, and admirable technicalities for their price points.","just wanted to see the unit variation and channel matching mostly also curious about the fit, and i know its semi custom, but how much of it protrudes out?","Very good channel matching as expected, I heard nothing amiss.","Regarding fit, it's always tricky to say because there is a whole spectrum of shell shapes, but it is medium size, and fairly opinionated.

This was back when I didn't do my usual measurements.","Non-sound impressions: Built beautifully. I just love the way it looks with the logo. The Oxygen is similar, but lacks the refinement; the slight border that accentuates the shell shape, the angel logo without the lettering, the slight embossing against the gray face, everything adds up to what is in my opinion the best mirror finished IEM >I've seen in a while. The packaging is fine like what others have said. A bulky yet high quality case, excellent T-APB tips, useless nozzles that have modding potential, and a somewhat lackluster cable in that it behaves like custom cable without having the feel and weight of one. I switched mine out for a custom gray-ish cable that matches the stainless metal and look. The fit is fine. These things are seriously tiny, I thought they would be a bigger Oxygen/Hana in both thickness and shell size, but it seems like only the former is true. The faceplate/body is still really small, and the fit with the extended nozzle and thickness is much better than that of the Oxygen/Hana in my experience. It's not the most secure or custom molded experience, but it works.","First impressions: Bass is definitely the weakest link. It's present, it's good, but on certain tracks it lacks volume. Every bass instrument/track is present, but it's almost always never the center focus. The mids and treble are great. It's essentially a perfected female poison tuning; really vocal forward that skirts the line between being too bright/shouty and being \"revealing\". Overall, in terms of tonal balance, it's pretty great. Most impressive is the treble quality, they somehow managed to make 1DD that imo needs very little to no tweaking for my ears.","Techs and dreams: Overall, it's really tech-y for a 1DD. Soundstage is surprising; usually, a tuning quirk in FR is used to enhance soundstage. An example would be killing the upper midrange on the andromedas, or elevating the treble on many other sets. In my experience, I rarely notice this change in soundstage, and instead the flawed timbre is what pops out. For the Origin, the mix of very separated midrange and bass, with non-peaky yet still elevated treble creates a sense of soundstage that is subtle but noticeable. I don't think this effect is going to stay consistent or even be present for long after my brain gets used to it. The imaging is just like any other IEM, but the enhanced soundstage makes it seem like everything is more separated, leading to a seemingly more focused sound presentation. Bass techs are where I find them to be the most complicated to connect with FR. Soundstage and imaging become similar for different sets if I EQ them to proper timbre, but techs related to bass often requires much more effort to remediate. The Origin has very low bass, but using EQ is effective and requires little fiddling to get to good levels for genres that need it.","Ok final Origins impressions: It's great. Doing this type of very mid/treble forward signature is very hard because it has to be balanced. Many sets try to boost that 3-8khz region because this leads to usually leads to more clarity, but very few manage to make it work with good treble like the Origin does. And the treble is really good to my ears, to the point where I'm not even remotely tempted to use EQ. I don't really know of any other 1DD that is this clean, energetic, and competent in what it sets out to do. I still think the bass is a bit lacking. A small cut at 250hz with a shelf at 125 seems to round out everything, but I only use this for hip hop and rap. Most other genres fare just as, if not better with the stock tuning where the bloat compensates for the forward mids.","based Orijimmy.

There's a reason male vocals are so subdued, thinned out and lacking the necessary heft in Shartman-tuned pos. There are ways to make female vocals really shine without emasculating male vocals in such way, so why? The real aim of the Shartman target was to enhance vocals of troons. It's really simple: troons have unmistakably male voices, but they're trying hard to sound more female and escape what in their twisted minds is stigma and unfortunate fate, but their male vocal cords will always get in the way and reveal who they really are. That's why the Shartman target, which aimed to be another neutral diffuse field but developer further to add room-specific characteristics to the sound, has since strayed from the path of neutrality and, under the guise of being a target preferred by the general population, became a target which makes female vocals sound prominent and bright while performing castration on male vocals. Think of it: it's the logical way to rob tranny vocals from manly heft and emphasize the feminine shine troons try to obtain. The way the Shartman target executes it is with a deep, slightly recessed tuck in the midbass (often called \"tranny tuck\" here) to take from the depth and weight, while emphasizing 5kHz shrill to add upper harmonics that are much necessary to enhance femininity of vocals. As a result, troon vocals are noticably shifted towards feminine character, fulfilling their desire to mask their inescapable manly heft to a great extent."]},{"l":"Softears Volume S Detached Faceplate","p":["15/02/2025","another L do i put it back together with superglue or epoxy?","ive heard superglue fumes are bad for drivers and epoxy is safe","i think the original adhesive must have been super glue though",">moondropped literally Softears is Moondrop","use T7000 or B7000 there's different color depending on application if you need transparent get the B","You put in in the box and send it back under warranty."]},{"i":"eletech--jomo-audio-mass-impressions","l":"Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions","p":["13/02/2025","Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions Went to Eletech/Jomo Audio HQ today and demoed some pos:",">Ame Mousa Very warm with tamed treble.

No unboxing because there's not much to show. My impressions so far (I suck at reviewing):*Although the soundstage isn't very spacious, it has a perceivable atmosphere. There's decent imaging to the point your inner eye can almost see how an instrument is played.*The instrument separation is great; you can single out one as easily as a thread in fabric and follow it as the song goes on.*The detail retrieval is pretty nice; I've discovered new sounds in relatively familiar tracks (e.g., that background jingle in We Drift Like Worried Fire at around 4:50).*The bass is textured and full-bodied but very lively and dynamic, also punchy when it needs to be. It extends beyond the soundstage, adding a lot to the atmosphere, and is definitely the highlight of this IEM.*The vocals feel intimate and natural (note to myself: try listening to some ASMR), and the mids are pretty clean overall.*The treble is crisp but can be very shouty (esp. in games) to the point I'll have to use EQ. What the fuck were they thinking?*The channel imbalance is there. That pestering thought that you might be going deaf won't leave your mind once you've noticed it, even if you know about the imbalance. The build and comfort are where my biggest disappointment comes from. The build is standard, but no attempt was made to make it slightly more ergonomic. The nozzles are huge, almost as huge as the pain in the ass you experience looking for the right eartips. At least the nozzles have lips. The cable is thick and seems durable, but it's fairly heavy and pulls on your ears, making this IEM rather uncomfortable and even painful to wear for prolonged periods of time. Also, at one point, I started to feel tingling at what seemed to be the exact points BC holes made contact with my skin. Well, I suppose it proves that bone conduction works. Is it worth it?

As for measurements, these were taken fresh out of the box, so no filter clogging or other issues should be present. Either the driver is different, which would explain the shift in resonant frequency between the two samples, or the filters are different enough to warrant this change. Does this matter?

Taking the dongle out and plugging it back in fixes the issue, but it is quite annoying. I'm not sure if this is a common issue or specific to my device, however I did check the legitimacy online with the QR code it came with so at least I can say that it's a legit dongle causing these issues. I also know that it's an issue with the dongle because my JM30 dongle doesn't have these issues.

The most common thought i have when switching between them is that the resolution just keeps getting better but they all sound relatively similar. None of them sound particularly bad, but you notice an increase in sound stage with every step up you do. The cool thing about the ignite x too is that they're shaped exactly like the wyverns so the comfort is 1:1. Ignite X could basically be seen as upgraded wyverns. The Plutus sound almost identical, but are the only ones shaped weird because of the BC driver. and man that BC driver makes bass fucking 3d. plutus still mogs but as far as tuning goes, all 3 are right up my alley.","If I were on a strict 50 dollar budget and couldn't go higher, the ignite x feels perfect.

Well built shells, fit is uncommonly decent for planar. Modest sensitivity, not hard to drive. Joins my top 3 planars (other two being OG P1 MAX and T10), edging out S12 Pro. S12 Pro too hot 6-12kHz and has usual wonky planar mids transition (i.e. early 2kHz peak and odd damping dip). P20 has more typical pinna gain resulting in appropriate female vocal timbre, balanced with warm thumpy bass and good treble extension.",">Aoshida E20 Decent case and cable. Well built shells, I never like unfinished 3-D print resin though. Shells are fairly small but aren't particularly ergonomic, so fit is just OK. Specs suggest less sensitive than most IEMs, and it is indeed the case. Surprisingly pleasant sound. I say that because I usually don't like tucked bass. Mid bass and lower mids still have enough body for my liking, and the general pros of Harman-like tuning are there, engaging sub bass and upper mids prominence. Can be a tad bright with the presence ~ 5kHz, but nothing offensive.>+80ohm adapter Good bassy fun and part of why I redeemed it. Still a realistic and listenable sound. In that regard, water-cooler talk and comparison to Deuce is apt. (I demo'd Deuce previously, not an AB comparison) The main difference is as graphs suggest, E20 has more prominence 5kHz upwards arguably better balancing appropriate amount of clarity to overcome high bass levels.

Upper mids and female vocals are centered but take a step back in bassier tracks. Uppermost treble rolls off naturally, a comfortable treble level. Most suitable if someone is prioritizing prominent mid bass thump / lower octave instrument articulation with balanced male and female vocals and safe treble.

Port orientation is irrelevant to me but some audiotards get their panties in a bunch over it. M1 Plus is microSD and USB-C on bottom, 3.5 + 4.4 on top. Fairly happy with the OS and UI/UX. Intuitive and simple, customization is done in a few minutes in only a few sub-menus.

The tuning is definitely more approachable with the extra bass and treble, but I wouldn't really recommend them as beginner IEM's due to the aforementioned misguided choice of materials and issues caused by it.","The EPZ Q1 Pro's on the other hand don't have removable filters and I do worry about how they'll fare with the inevitable clog, but them being made out of resin and having a more extruded nozzle do make a major difference in the fit and comfort, they don't fall out like the Chu 2's and the stock tips are perfectly fine. The Harman tuning is definitely flatter, but it's nothing a little 200Hz low pass shelf can't fix if you want that extra bass, your ears get used to the stock tuning anyways.

They're so grippy and soft that at the first insertion they grip to your ears, then you just bend them around the mounting ring instead of pushing them further. You have to let go, let them get back to the original shape, push in again, and essentially knead them in for a bit and then they're perfectly fitted. A bit more finicky but it's not too bad. They don't seem to suffer from \"wet ear\" that much where my ear moisture starts making them slippery and overly noisy, they isolate sound from the outside much like any stock tips, and the deeper fit/wider bore actually give it more bass which is good to have.

Here's a quick rewrite.","To whoever rec'd that thing like 2 weeks ago, thank you it's great. For anyone looking for a dongle to use with an app or device that doesn't support software EQ like Netflix or something, this thing works. You get 5 bands PEQ, gain range of -12dB to 12dB, quality range of 0.25q to 8.0q, and you get peak, hsq, and lsq filters. There's also a gain slider. If you need the entire 24dB range to fix something with EQ this thing probably isn't powerful enough to drive it unless they're very easy to drive IEMs, since I had to crank to 80% on my phone with -12dB on 64Ohm earbuds (don't know the sensitivity). It can be challenging to make a good EQ preset with 5 bands, but it's better than no EQ and for 15 euros that's all I can ask for.","same happened to me. ctrl+c before you post anything longer i guess... good review thx","I usually do, but forgot this time. Oh well.","What's up with their janky ass firmware, what are the fixes doing. Is the web version of the configurator still broken. I'm not following closely since I already have system-wide EQ everywhere I need and my dongle is more powerful.","I didn't even know they had a web version of the configurator, but I've gotten it set up now using the app and I don't feel like checking it out rn. Yeah the app kinda sucks, but once you have the EQ set you don't really need to anymore so I don't really care. Some things I noticed are that when you upload the EQ to the dongle it cuts out the audio and you have to start whatever you were listening to back up. Also I'm not entirely certain but I think there is a difference in sound before and after uploading the preset to the dongle despite the PEQ GUI clearly being live. I also have system-wide EQ on my phone and PC and I have a JM30 that I really enjoy, however unlike Spotify the Netflix app can't be cracked to allow audio recordings which breaks my EQ setup on my phone. So far I've noticed that the JM30 gets much louder, but I haven't noticed any noise on the JA11 so far. If I do notice anything weird I'll be sure to come back with an update.","Pro tip, you can save 1 or 2 shelf filters by moving the entire graph to your desired level of bass/treble.","Yeah I did something like that. I first tried to use one 0.25q peak cut to reduce the mids and fix the treble with a shelf which wasn't really all that close to my usual preset. I changed that to two high shelf filters which not only allowed me to have something similar to my usual bass and treble, but also allowed me to get the mids much closer to my target with one less filter than usual. I need the other three bands to fix some peaks and dips in the treble, so I only really have 2 bands to set the general shape."]},{"i":"anon-visits-the-zhangout","l":"Anon visits the (Z)Hangout","p":[">64 Audio U12T (with M20 module) A smoother Fei Wan, with less jarring treble peaks.

Tight and detailed bass and boosted treble for techs. Mids sound leaner than it graphs – reminds me of the Monarch MK3. While the Fei Wan is highly resolving, it doesn’t sound cohesive. Not that impressed, I think the U12T and Annihilator do it better, and for way cheaper. 7.5/10.",">Canpur CP622B Mega5EST without the bloat. Actually nice separation. Very inoffensive tuning but I'm not sure about forking out $3500 for the audiophilia equivalent of plain water. Again, there's no real faults with the Canpur, it's just...boring.",">Elysian Acoustics Annihilator 2023 (USD$3000) Lives up to the hype. Extremely clinical and incredibly resolving – TOTL “techs”. Only complaint is that it is TOO clinical – music sounds cold and there’s no sub-bass thump. But minor flaw like this can be forgiven when the upside is so great. You WILL believe in “techs” once you hear this IEM. 10/10.",">Eminent Ears Ruby Another summit-fi IEM with hot treble. I call this the “class 3 listener” tuning – lesser bass and more crisp and airy treble. Also sacrificing mids for female vocal specialization. Male vocals sound anemic. Joins the likes of the Empire Ears Odin and Aroma Feiwan. Summit-fi manufacturers really love doing this sort of tuning.",">Empire Ears Odin (US$3400) Female vocals have a slight edginess and unnatural extension to them. Suffers from overenergetic treble like the Camelot. But good timbre and very wide-sounding. Lows and mids are okay, if you cope hard enough the Odin is usable. 5/10.",">Fearless x Crinacle Dawn Looks like Crin already did New Meta 4 years ago. This thing is better than the Mega5EST in every way. Better quality bass and more resolving in the uppermids/treble. Subjectively, I would rank the Fearless as 30% better than the M5E.",">Ice Lab Prismatica Obscure pos that nobody talks about. Overly bloaty mid-bass and an aggressive pinna+treble to overcompensate. Not worth the trade-off, it sounds like an unrefined or muddy V-shape with no microdetails. However, there is a certain “fullness” in the midrange compared to your typical Harman, which might entice a specific subset of listeners. Also has quite a tamed treble, so no fear of sibilance I guess. 6/10.",">IOAudio Volare and Sogno SM4 is better than both IOAudio iems. The Volare sounds identical to the SM4 but with poorer techs. Also, the massive shell hurts my delicate earussy. Utter pos. Crin really approved this?",">Melodic Artification Alter Ego (USD$2500) Classic Harman tuning like the SM4 and Truthear Nova. Bass switch adds body and warmth which sounds like New Meta-adjacent. Both tunings are really good without sacrificing resolution. Sounds like a refined Monarch MK3 without its recessed mids. If you think of this as 2 IEMs in 1, the value proposition is not that bad. 9.5/10.",">Nightjar Singularity Incredible bass - detailed and very deep. Timbre is natural and accurate. Female vocals are clean, and plenty of sparkle despite the boosted low-end. However, on certain songs with a constant low-end presence, the bass becomes distracting, as the Singularity gives you a persistent sub-bass rumble which never stops. The bass-heavy tuning also results in a peculiar soundstage: the cello is too close, but the violin is too far. The timpani is too close, but snare drum sounds too far. Piano timbre also varies because low-end keystrokes are too pronounced.",">Nostalgia Audio Camelot (USD$2600) VERY boomy bass and energetic treble. Aggressive V-shape. The Camelot is too shrill and sibilant for me. Mids might as well not exist. 0/10.",">Nostalgia Audio Durandal (USD$2420) Same problem as with the EE Odin. Sibilant, raspy female vocals. Harman-adjacent tuning but barely on the level of the SM4. 2/10.",">Softears RS10 Slightly warm, veiled, and low-res. Maybe the demo unit was broken because this thing doesn’t even sound as good as the Salnotes Zero. It’s akin to hearing an IEM at such low volume that you can’t even begin to describe its sound signature, that’s how I feel when listening to the RS10.",">Softears RSV Twilight but with thumping sub-bass and a bit more added treble. I think the slight V-shape tuning hurts the timbre of the RSV and makes it sound worse than the Twilight. There’s no reason for the RSV to exist because the Twilight is just the clear upgrade in every way and I would pay the extra $200 every time. 6/10.",">Softears Twilight Endgame 1DD for musicality. Warm and intimate sounding without heavy thumping sub-bass. A very smooth and relaxing listen. The bass decay is slow but life-like and natural, and it doesn’t sound muddy at all. In fact, I think it’s more resolving than hybrids like the Mega5EST, V16 Divinity and Xenns Top. Soundstage may be lacking because vocals sound so intimate, but I think that’s more of a pro than a con. 10/10.",">Subjective preference Annihilator > Alter Ego > VE10 > Odin > Durandal > Camelot",">Subjective Ranking Fearless > Supernova > Prestige > RS10",">Subjective ranking Twilight > U12T > Fei Wan > Prismatica > RSV",">Symphonium Crimson Bright detailed treble, and equally detailed bass. However, the Crimson lacks sub-bass slam (because it’s a BA-only set?). The bass is punchy but there’s no physicality to it. Unremarkable mids, with female vocals being slightly recessed to give a sense of wider soundstage. Guitar plucks have that summit-fi extension and detail but low-end instruments (like the tuba) sound lifeless.",">Thieaudio Monarch MK3 50% better than SM4. This is probably what endgame Harman sounds like. V-shape with boosted lows and highs. Kilobuck techs and resolution.",">Thieaudio Origin Didn’t like it. Mids and treble were decent but the BC driver was distracting. Maybe it was poor fit, but I could never predict when the BC driver was going to kick in, so rather than aiding in audio reproduction, it just felt like someone was tickling my ear at random intervals.",">Thieaudio V16 Divinity Infinitely better than SM4. Now this I like a lot. A warmer sounding Monarch MK3, whilst retaining most of its upper mids and treble tech. I’ve always felt that the Mega5EST had perfect timbre but poor resolution and air, and the V16 fixes that. V16 is JM-1 perfected.",">Vision Ears EXT MK2 Punchy bass, detailed treble, recessed mids.

Samsung K3. Before streaming services, you could legally download music onto this via Napster (which was at that time a legal entity with a subscription plan). The platform had a lot of leverage behind its name so it was able to get vast libraries of any musician's catalogues including rare releases and things.","So I would be walking around in that era carrying ALL the music I wanted to listen to forever, when at the time an album was £10 to download. Didn't have to dig through limewire for the right files or pay big money, just copy+pasted them directly from the artist page into my mp3 player. This was a good 6-8 years before it became normal to own music so easily, or possible to stream it on the go reliably. Curiously if you stopped paying the monthly bill your music would also stop playing, it would check your status every time you charged it.","The design language was also nice, it looks very samsung, and has aged quite well I'd say. Obviously this was before we had touch screens, so this device had a haptic control where you tapped up or down and it inputted the feedback that way, with the screen above.","I just got a rush of nostalgia thinking about it for the first time in so long."]},{"i":"kz-edc-pro--cb1200au-dac-review","l":"KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review","p":["13/11/2024","KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review Ok I'm going to keep this quite short.","Fit is really good, some of KZ's best since the early semi-customs days way back. It's similar to others like the Libra, but has small tweaks that make it a bit better, such as the dip in the lower part of the shell so that it hooks on to the ear more. Looks are fine, better than usual but far from good looking. At least it's not a QDC connection.","Sound is good and is very similar to the Libra, which for people that read my review should know that it sounded very good especially for the price, but could use some tweaking in the bass. Same thing here, everything is balanced and \"generic\".","Channel matching is relatively disappointing for KZ, and is somewhat noticeable on my end in the midrange. I'm being picky here for this type of release. Distortion (104dB) is decent, but nothing great or even good.","Overall, it's a good set but again, nothing particularly remarkable. Chances are you already have something very similar if you've been in the game for a while. It's a testament to the level of performance you can get at extreme budget prices, but it's hard to get excited.","KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review I also got a DAC with customizable PEQ: 8 peak filters, Q values from 0.1 to 5, gain values from -10.0 to 10.0 dB, and playback volume adjustment (ie preamp). There are 8 built-in presets, and 4 custom ones, although you can modify all of them to your liking (ie 12 customizable presets). The EQ setting saves itself unto the DAC. The EQ values seem accurate enough (correct gain and Q, frequency is a bit imprecise, veering off by a couple of hz). It uses the WalkPlay app where you need to register, so use a throwaway email. It's a CB1200AU DAC chip, so anything with it should work with the app and have EQ capabilities.","The DAC itself is unfortunately noisy. Using it on Android with the default sample rate and bit depth (48/16) results in very prominent noise floor and distortion. Switching to the advertised 32bit results in less noise and no distortion (which I'm assuming is a result of the Android audio stack) but requires much more volume to get to the same output. The noise is not extreme, but it is very noticeable during silence. Normal volume music masks it mostly.","It's a decent device, and is a rather solid EQ option for those on a budget (around $5). Just beware that it has a noise floor that will certainly not suit higher dynamic range music such as classical, or \"low-density\" music (ie acoustical/instrumental tracks, jazz, etc).","Not a bad measuring POS at all really. This or TRN MT5? The latter hasn’t been making any waves but seems pretty decent too albeit generic","Tough question. Both can be had at around the same price right now, so it wholly depends on the looks, comfort, and small yet important differences in sound. KZ EDC Pro & CB1200AU DAC Review Both don't look great, but the very generic and simple look of the MT5 is great if a sleek look is needed. I feel like the bass on the MT5 is better controlled, whereas the EDC Pro is a bit too much and veers into being muddy and slow. There's also the ear gain peak shift, but that's completely up to preference, and isn't all that important (ie not much change).","Comfort on the EDC Pro is better personally because the shell fills my ears better and there's a level of snugness that isn't on the MT5. Also the QDC >>>connection on the MT5 is not ideal for me in terms of cable comfort (not to mention cool third party cables), but I wouldn't buy the KZs if the plan is to use the stock cable.","Durability remains to be seen, but I assume the EDC Pro will last longer considering my Conch suffers pretty badly from condensation-related drops in volume."]},{"i":"tri-i3-mk3-kinera-celest-relentless-hisenior-mega5est-impressions","l":"TRI I3 MK3, Kinera Celest Relentless, Hisenior Mega5EST Impressions","p":["09/11/2024","TRI I3 MK3, Kinera Celest Relentless, Hisenior Mega5EST Impressions 3 most recent pos: TRI I3 MK3: Good mids-forward tuning.

All measurements were done using JVC Spiral Dots++ tips and an aftermarket 4.4mm cable. Source is the Tanchjim Luna weeb edition, all units were measured at the same volume and then offset in REW to make the graph more readable. Samples 2-6 were ordered roughly 2-3 weeks ago, sample 1 was ordered roughly a month ago. Samples 2-6 were purchased across various Aliexpress stores, with sample 1 coming direct from KZ. Samples 3 and 6 have acceptable channel balance but sample 5 is the only one I'd call good. Sample 1 is bad, sample 2 is almost okay, and sample 4 is awful. Depending on your standards, 50% to 66% of units are decent. I understand why crapzo bought a bunch of CRAs, it's the only way to guarantee you get a good pair. Mixing and matching gave me one \"golden\" pair, the left channel from sample 3 and the right channel from sample 6. Other stuff about the IEM, the build is incredibly solid, not just for the price. It's all metal and the comfort is better than every other KZ I've tried. The shell is just as nice as the EA500LM shell, slightly more comfortable and I think it looks better too. The build was the reason I decided to do this experiment, I figured I'd spend about as much as the EA500LM to see if I could get a good pair after the first pair I ordered ended up having not so great channel matching. Sound wise the Saga is decently bassy, with an irritating spike at 11.3K to my ears and slightly muddy lower mids but otherwise not really deficient in any other area. The ear gain and treble are still a few dB too much for my taste but that's a matter of preference. I can't recommend KZ unless you have your own coupler and are willing to buy roll the dice on multiple units to do the QC yourself. The stock cable is also an abomination as expected.

Haven't had any major clogging issues but I'm not confident . Looks nice and plain.","Sound: Surprisingly good. Using tips for deep insertion; treble is relatively smooth, maybe a minor peak here and there. Not missing much in terms of treble information/resolution, but I'll check thoroughly later. This actually reminds me of the Wan'er but with more treble. While bass seems to be more, it is very lacking and needs a sub bass boost to bring back some rumble and body. Channel matching is good (the very small imbalance in sub bass is not really noticeable), distortion is also far from an issue.","Conclusion: It's good, really good. I'm not spending too much time on this because it's just another IEM that performs well, but it is commendable that a well-built, comfortable, and good sounding IEM can be had for around $5.

First thing I did was change tips. I ended up on something with shallower insertion depth, but with much better seal, which in turn improved the bass drastically; a small sub bass boost is still nice but far from necessary now. The previous tips were very comfortable, but any small jaw movement would ever so slightly break the seal.","As for EQ, I didn't do much, just a very small bump around 10khz just to increase resolution. Everything seems to match my hearing perfectly, I'm rather surprised.","Compared to other 1DD in terms of sound quality, it is excellent to my ears, and I wouldn't be mad if this was the only IEM I could use from now on.","TRN MT5 Review And here are the results from a bit of quick modding. Seems like foams are ideal for that 5khz peak in case it is too prominent on some units. Didn't notice a huge difference there. However, it seems like the front vent is dropping a good amount of bass. Haven't listened to this last one as the vent blocking was due to the coupler pressing against the tip dome/umbrella and covering the vent. Becomes a bit uncontrolled and has some driver flex and pressure issue. Maybe a light filter will work."]},{"l":"Lepic Nuon Clears and Coreir Al Tips Impressions and Measurements","p":["22-23/10/2024","Lepic Nuon Clears and Coreir Al tips impressions and measurements New Japanese tips, got the Lepic (le epic xDD) Nuon Clears and the new Coreir AL.

Swapping for a 500 mesh filter, which looks identical apart for the surrounding glue, brought it back to its original tuning.

The EJ07 successor prototype was solid, afaik it will be 1DD+4BA(?)+4EST, with tuning relatively similar to OG EJ07 which is fairly balanced. ETA release early next year. Nightjar Singularity and Duality are both good as far as retaining a natural timbre and presentation, but are definitely more bass-enhanced sets.

Nice shell with no sharp edges, very good (albeit thin) cable that behaves very well, good tips that actually fit the large nozzle, and nice little gifts too. Remains to be seen if the reflective faceplate will ever scratch, but after a week and a half, nothing has appeared.","Fit is one of two reasons why I bought this, and it doesn't disappoint. Very nice fitting, and the general size of it allows for very good tip compatibility in terms of comfort and stability. It is a decent bit bigger than the Chu 2, but still much smaller than the average IEM; depending on the tips used, it sits flush inside the ear.","Tanchjim 4U Review(check archive for full resolution) Sound quality","It sounds fine. Not much else to say really, it sounds like any well tuned, competent IEM. The overall tonal balance is very good. Treble is a bit on the spicy side, but nothing major either. Again, not much else to say. Do note that I'm using the stock small wide bore tips, so it is inserted quite deeply.","The other reason I bought this is for the tuning gimmick, which works surprisingly well. Between the most and second most options, the difference is relatively minor. The third most is significantly different than the previous two, and has a very \"earbud\" like presentation. The fourth has the least bass, and is too far gone. The issue with both of these last options is that the amount of lost sub bass is not compensated properly with mid bass like it is with earbuds. For most people, the first three options are the only worthwhile ones in my opinion.","Picrel are the measurements. Distortion is very impressive (no precise values since I haven't calibrated the coupler this time), as well as channel matching: ignore the small difference between channels around 6khz, it is most probably my fault.","Tanchjim 4U Review Finally, for the gazette, a size comparison with the Chu 2.

At higher volumes, S12 2024’s planar timbre is worse than the T10 – cymbals have an unnatural shimmer and wind instruments have a metallic sheen. Also, the S12 2024 is prone to sibilance, so tip-rolling is required. I found DUNU S&S tips to work but foam tips would be better.","Comparisons with Artti T10 S12 2024 sounds a tad cleaner than the T10 but articulation is sometimes sharpened to the point of harshness. Call it “better techs” if you want, but I’d still choose the T10 because it isn’t as sibilant/painful to listen to. Ultimately both planars sound very similar and any difference is just a nitpicking exercise.","Comparisons with Mega5-EST The S12 2024 does sound more detailed than the Mega5est probably since the S12 has a noticeably quicker bass decay which gives it a cleaner midrange and better instrument separation.","New meta IEMs (like the DaVinci, KE4) sound muddy in comparison, but I wouldn’t call the S12 2024 a highly resolving set, since the S12’s excessive \"SH\" and \"S\" energy in female vocals can occasionally overpower the treble and cause higher pitch instruments to sound less detailed (masking the shimmer from cymbals and jingle from the tambourine).","Cons The set is library/track dependent. Poor fit for jpop/kpop. I want to say instrumentals/classical is fine since I liked Vivaldi on the S12 2024, but it’s a genre with high dynamic range so I’ve had tracks cross into the harshness threshold even on low volume.","inb4 planars are not meant for listening at high volume At low volume the S12 2024 is painfully average.

Absolutely not a single sound or hissing when nothing is playing or connected. It's built like a tank, very heavy metal frame. Conclusion: absolutely recommended. The Gatos are, unsurprisingly, what you can expect for 20 freedombucks. They are not bad by any metric, and better than pretty much everything else not chink on this price bracket and maybe a little more. The bass is non existent unless you EQ, then it's kinda there. They are on the brighter side in general, lower treble is good, but when you go higher it shits the bed, also hi-hats sound awful. The mids and vocals are okayish, but very straightforward which I personally like. I can't talk about fit because my ear canal is weird and I never had a single in-ear fit in there snuggly.

As always, beware of KZ/CCA stealth revisions.","DAC/Amps/Accessories>Kiwi Ears Allegro Mini Novel form factor>Tanchjim Cable X Looks interesting. Hopefully better than Moondrop's DSP cable implementations.>Tanchjim Luna Again, nothing particularly worthwhile, but damn does it look good. APx555 measurements show excellent performance.>Fiio BTR13 Looks great, and could be the Q5K replacement everybody's been waiting for. Good BT codec support, good DAC chips, and decent PEQ implementation. Battery on other models in the same family has been lackluster.>Too many dongle DAC/amps Not listing all of them. A lot of CS43131 being used, and they're getting cheaper and cheaper.","News and events:>Nothing new really.>New paper (Harman - Sean Olive) on 5128 targets coming this AES convention in October."]},{"l":"Least demanding advice seeker","p":["01/09/2024","best IEMs for Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Avant-Garde, European Folk, Memphis Blues, New Orleans Blues, Chicago Blues, Texas Blues, Delta Blues, British Blues, Psychedelic Blues, West Coast, Jazz Blues, Country Blues, Boogie Woogie, Country, Progressive Country, Folk, Rockabilly, Jazz, Dixieland, Big Band, Bebop, Hard Bop, Free Jazz, Avant-Garde Jazz, Garage Rock, Blues Rock, Rock, Blues Rock, Jazz Fusion, Funk, Soul, Folk-Rock, Proto-Punk, Psychedelic Rock, Progressive Rock, Krautrock, Kosmische musik, Eclectic Prog, Symphonic Prog, Italian Prog, Zeuhl, Avant-Prog/RIO, Space Rock, Progressive Folk, Progressive Electronic, Neoclassical new-age, Dark cabaret, Symphonic Rock, Progressive Pop, Avant-Folk, Glam Rock, Gothic Rock, Punk, Hardcore Punk, Post-Hardcore, Art-Punk, Progressive Punk, Post-Punk, Anarcho Punk, Afro-Punk, Celtic Punk, Ska, Horror Punk, Christian Punk, Crust Punk, Skate Punk, Egg Punk, Glam Punk, Cowpunk, Nazi Punk, Oi!, Deathrock, Anti-Folk, Art Rock, Folk Punk, Pop-Punk, New Wave, Heavy Metal, Power Metal, Thrash Metal, Death Metal, Melodic Death Metal, Progressive Metal, Glam Metal, Stoner Metal, Avant-Garde Metal, Black Metal, Atmospheric Black Metal, Melodic Black Metal, Symphonic Black Metal, Industrial Metal, Groove Metal, Jazz Metal, Doom Metal, Drone Metal, Post-Metal, Nu-Metal, Pop Metal, Metalcore, Folk Metal, Drone Metal, Shoegaze, Blackgaze, Math Rock, Art Pop, Indie Folk, Lofi, Avant-Pop, Tropical Goth, Post-Avant Jazzcore, Progressive Dreamfunk, Neofolk, Neoclassical Darkwave, Noise Rock, Noise, Ambient/Drone, Post-Rock, Film OST, Anime OST, Video Game OST, EDM, IDM, Techno, Dungeon Synth, Downtempo, Trip Hop, Eurobeat, Lowercase, Synth-Pop, House, Acid House, Eurohouse, Deep House, Chicago House, Electro swing, Intelligent Drum and Bass, Jazzstep, Synth-Punk, Ambient Techno, Ambient Dub, Dark Ambient, Sophisti-pop, Synth-Pop, Synth-Metal, Ethereal Wave, Nu-Gaze, Japanoise, Danger Music, Glitch, Folktronica?"]}],[{"l":"Music Editorial","p":["Everything music in iemg.","Anyone that wants to review, give impressions, or simply recommend (or not) a newly released album/single is welcome to.

Don't normally listen to pop but this was surprisingly not terrible. The songs are different enough to keep it engaging but stay on theme. Album is Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay.>She Looked Like Me Probably the worst song of the album. That overbaring bass thump at ~ 055 and another time towards the end just ruins it for me.>Killing Time The song that prompted a review. Superb opening, should have been the opening track. Would have been nice if they kept the energy going but instead it goes into true blue interlude.>Death and Romance Stereotypical repetitive pop song. Album certainly picks up after here though with some bangers. I think they should have just dropped tracks 1 and 3-5 and had a normal length album with all around decent tracks. The lyrics aren't particularly inspiring and the vocalist (at least in this album) has the range of a teaspoon so they would have to do something reasonably different in their other albums to keep me interested (first time listening to them). Also the music is nice but most tracks don't really have the depth that would keep me listening when I'm not preoccupied. There was one track near the start that needs crossfeed on IEMs, I can't remember which one though and the infringement isn't present in any other songs."]}],[{"l":"IEMGallery","p":["A collection of the hottest, weirdest, repulsive, intriguing, mythical, and influential IEMs. Only pics with singular IEMs are included."]}],[{"l":"Board Migration","p":["Talk about timing.
