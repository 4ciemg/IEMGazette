Sounds and feels so warm, there's something here that makes it so good and addicting, but I can't exactly pinpoint what it is. Perfect album for relaxing, and the cover is very neat.

Really fun, enjoyable, and energetic for such a short project. Not all that familiar with this genre or artist but I'm looking forward to what they have next.

## MUSIC - Playboi Carti (14/03/2025)

Weird but familiar, incorporating not only his past works, but also southern mixtape traits. It does feel a bit long, and many tracks feel incomplete or not all that standout within the whole project. It is bloated, and I feel like that is a part of its charm as a throwback to old mixtapes. Just have to take the songs I liked and make my own cassette :p

Loved the instrumentation on this, cool and relaxing textures that are still engaging. Also gorgeous album cover, I'm in love with it.

## Museum Music - Edward Skeletrix / Im A Monster (01/01/2025)

*05/01/2025*

Technically two posts but who cares.

Steers away from Skeletrix Language, and feels the most strange with jarring transitions, awkward song structures, and weird production. It is rather polarizing, but I'm in love with it.
Favorite part is the whole sequence from God Made You A Monster to Killing Over Likes which covers all of the previous points and more.

It's good, closer to Skeletrix Language in terms of production and musical form. Feels more fleshed out and out there in terms of experimentation. Favorite track is Real One, great production and vocal inflection variety here.

>Only some real music. Gazettezo put this in there not a perfect album but almost certainly AOTY comparing it to what else we've gotten this year.

## Imaginal Disk - Magdalena Bay  (23/08/2024)

>[![Imaginal Disk - Magdalena Bay](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A16ANsQnMxL.jpg){width=300}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPe7tn_Hju4)
>I'll keep it short. Don't normally listen to pop but this was surprisingly not terrible. The songs are different enough to keep it engaging but stay on theme. 
>Album is Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay.
>\>She Looked Like Me
>Probably the worst song of the album. That overbaring bass thump at ~055 and another time towards the end just ruins it for me.
>\>Killing Time
>The song that prompted a review. Superb opening, should have been the opening track. Would have been nice if they kept the energy going but instead it goes into true blue interlude.
>\>Death and Romance
>Stereotypical repetitive pop song. Album certainly picks up after here though with some bangers.
>I think they should have just dropped tracks 1 and 3-5 and had a normal length album with all around decent tracks. The lyrics aren't particularly inspiring and the vocalist (at least in this album) has the range of a teaspoon so they would have to do something reasonably different in their other albums to keep me interested (first time listening to them). Also the music is nice but most tracks don't really have the depth that would keep me listening when I'm not preoccupied. There was one track near the start that needs crossfeed on IEMs, I can't remember which one though and the infringement isn't present in any other songs.
