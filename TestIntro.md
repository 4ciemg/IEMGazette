##IEM size database project

A project for somewhat standardized pictures of IEMs is currently ongoing. Many issues still have to be ironed out; stay tuned!
Pictures can be found in the [archive](https://mega.nz/folder/cchSBaBQ#WwAguZeGclZkxzvwVNSryQ), for which differentt IEMs are noted in this [database](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/n2mA+-1PHR6zeFf7yeCm9bRbwlL993dLZajDduujqsI/embed/).

The rules so far are as follow:
- Include a solid reference for size, ideally a ruler. other references, such as an apple dongle, a usb c termination, and/or eartips are possible alternatives/add-ons
- The iems have to be "naked", with no eartips or cables attached (ok for reference). For multiple iems, align them properly, and use the same positions/angles
- Show two important sides: the faceplate size, and the depth of the iem, the latter also showcasing the nozzle size and angle
- Ensure the photo angle is as vertical as possible to eliminate possible dimension skewing
- Leave a decent margin around the photographed items
- Use a grid paper as the background if possible, and specify the grid size
