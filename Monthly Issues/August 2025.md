*29-31/08/2025*

Unboxing here.

>TOTL anon here, it's been a while, I hope you schizos have been well.

>Anyways as promised I bought the Palavox Akasha, here's an unboxing dump

>>>POS collection status report (and +Salnotes Zero which I didn't bother including in the pic).
>>>
>>>Akasha impressions a few days later
>>>>Sup bro neat new pos. I'll look forward to demoing Akasha someday. Any insight about the company? Just some new young guys based in Shenzhen?
>>>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/BbqSbmhr/Palavox-Akasha-Unboxing-Impressions-4.png)
>>>>>iirc Palavox is the higher-end sister brand of Artpical. Unfortunately their team is made up of faceless vets, but they do know how to tune. Primarily their appeal is the avant garde aesthetic of their pos (just look at Artpical Bloody Angel)
>>>>>>...that's quite something
>>>>>
>>>>>>Wow that's amazing. I like how it borders on being both flashy but also minimalistic. It's a nice break from the the usual 'gemstone' cliche.
>
>>Why did you buy that pos...
>>>To support my local retailer for taking the risk of importing niche "literally-who" sets
>>>
>>>\>that storm already has baby versions of it
>>>Such as? I've probably heard over a thousand pos by now (courtesy of living next to thehangout), and I still have yet to come across a budget alternative to recommend to newfags
>>>>mini storm- xenns top pro, ziigaat odyssey
>>>>mini top pro- ziigaat crescent
>>>>\>probably heard over a thousand pos by now
>>>>doubtful
>>>>>\>mini storm- xenns top pro, ziigaat odyssey
>>>>>\>mini top pro- ziigaat crescent

>>WOW editorzo finally has a job again!!
>>>pretty sure editorzo abandoned the gazette
>
>>welcome back TOTLzo, I was tired with constant war of deafzos, craving some posts written by someone who actually uses his ears
>>waiting for cable reviews, impressions of various OFC vs silver vs silver-plated OFC models and differences in sound

Impressions here.
>![](https://i.postimg.cc/jdp1hDT5/Palavox-Akasha-Unboxing-Impressions-5.png)
>Impressions after using Palavox Akasha over the weekend:
>TLDR: Mid-forward, extremely wide-sounding, shrill air-maxxing pos with literally no mid-bass.
>
>\>Timbre
>Akasha has this really clean and analytical tuning to it as a result of having zero mid-bass impact. Upper-mids and treble energy causes the Akasha to be shrill-sounding with lots of air/shimmer. But it is not lean-sounding, A/Bing with something like the Helios, you can tell the Akasha does have relatively thick lower-mids to it, but most of the time it is overpowered with its shrillness.
>
>\>Bass
>No idea why Palavox even bothered putting a DD. Akasha has zero mid-bass. As for subbass, the Akasha does have BCD drivers which gives a slight hint of subbass rumble and texture. Bass on the Akasha is best described as ‘rumble with no slam/decay’.
>
>\>Uppermids/Treble
>Akasha is quite the shrill pos, but because of its late pinna gain, it’s not shouty – female vocals have this breathy texture, and the midrange has this glassy sheen to it. The Akasha has tons of air and is very extended – much better than the Helios.
>
>\>Soundstage
>One of its strong points. Very wide-sounding. Comparable to Storm in that regard.
>
>\>Cons
>Noteweight for lower-register instruments is a real problem area: the lack of mid-bass punch and slam makes bass guitar sound really anemic; you can barely make out the strumming. It’s impossible to hear the initial “thump” on the jazz drums so all you get is the constant shimmering of cymbals/snares.
>
>I wouldn’t use the Akasha for instrumentals because Akasha just lacks that initial slam to give instruments authority.
>
>\>Pros
>Detail monster with great separation for busy/fast electronic tracks or female poison genres like jpop/kpop. Transients are sharp and fast, and the lack of mid-bass bloom/decay allows you to scrutinize details in the music.
>
>Verdict: Very unique tuning and worth demo-ing for the experience. Canjam goers should make an effort to audition this pos if possible.
>>ok nigga... now cable/source/tip/rock roll and do a 180 with your opinion

## Anon's thoughts on TWS
*31/08/2025*

>I have in fact abandoned true wireless and gone back to wired headphones. Spent months sourcing a pair of Momentum in-ear from Japan lol. I also got several Sony Walkmans with built-in ANC piping to wired earbuds, and imo they easily sound better than any true wireless product up to $200.
>True wireless is a huge source of electronic trash. Extra batteries, short shelf life/designed to be unrepairable. Railway workers in Japan have to pick up from the tracks, dozens of them falling out of people's ears each day, they even invented special contraptions for this. You can't be green or sensible and still use one of these things, that's just hypocrisy at the highest level. And - even LDAC is not as good as a physical cable. I'm just gonna say it. These 6-8 years was just one big running around for nothing, My answer is I've gone back to the wired earphones I'd been using before all this and I'm happy as a clam. Should have never fallen for the true wireless con.
>True wireless is nice some of the time, but I also realized later on that I only "can't tolerate cable" when I'm having low-energy days. It's a great reminder to work on my health.
>>ehh I love my tws when I'm exercising
>>and when I'm doing shit that needs 2 hands and I want some music to drone out the boredom

## IEM Collection Impressions 
*29/08/2025*

>Just wanted to thank whoever steered me towards the EPZ P50 and Tanchjim Origin a few threads back. Nice sets. The pos I have now I enjoy them in this order:
>EPZ P50 => Tanchjim Origin > Chopin => Nova >> Kiwi Ears Astral
>I tried the Origin first and I was surprised by how pleasant the signature was. From the frequency curve I wasn't expecting it. It's definitely bright leaning but the mid bass hump compensates for it perfectly. My only complaint would be the heavy-weight shells; they feel premium but they fall off if I try to sleep with them.
>The P50 were underwhelming at first but I later realized how balanced it is; nothing stands out too much and everything is a relaxed listen. My favorite set so far as this is what I usually look for. Very comfortable, I also ordered a custom design as I don't like the original look very much, nice option.
>The KE Astral were a complete disappointment. They definitely are fun at first but they have an absolute ridiculous high treble peak (9dB! @ 15kHz) which is extremely noticeable, everything sounds unnaturally airy and cymbals sound disgusting. Not sure why reviewers don't comment this, so far I've only seen TimTuned mention it but it totally ruins the set for me, otherwise they'd be fine. I can only think that most people who review these already have some hearing loss above 14kHz and thus don't notice it. But it sounds terrible to me, especially if coming from other pos/headphones/speakers. I can hear up to 17kHz and I'm sure many people here can too so I definitely wouldn't recommend them.
>The Chopin/Nova are my favorite Harman sets, but I don't enjoy Harman too much. The Chopin are more comfortable to wear and are more fun, but the mid bass hump is a bit too much for me. The Nova are more relaxed (which I enjoy more) but I had to change the eartips as they started to fall off and the female 2-pin plug of the left side doesn't hold the male connector anymore and they fall off so I don't use them anymore.
>>\>sleeping with origins
>>lol
>>\>nothing stands out too much and everything is a relaxed listen.
>>true, nothing special but that's what's special about it in a way
>>\>Not sure why reviewers don't comment this
>>i also had a very prominent peak in the treble but i think this might be an hrtf and hearing age issue
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/j2zMgXK9/IEM-Collection-Impressions.png)
>>>\>i think this might be an hrtf and hearing age issue
>>>The peak is prominent in the measurements I've seen. Not that treble peaks are uncommon, but it might be annoying if you're sensitive to treble.
>>>>right but whether or not this is a problem for each person is up to hrtf and hearing age
>>>>>Oh yeah definitely. Preference is subjective after all.
>>>
>>>>this peak is literally why it is called astral
>>>>>didn't know stars sounded like shit
>
>>Nice you settled on some stuff you like. Yup P50 is pretty great, I often reach for it even with lots of others.

## NiceHCK YD520 Impressions
*27/08/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/bYHdPt6m/Nice-HCK-YD520-Impressions.jpg)
>Nicehck YD520 are pretty good for $15. These might replace the ED9 pro as my favorite bullet IEMs.
>They don't stick out far at all, I can sleep on my side with these against the pillow. Great overall balance and imaging. Build quality is cheap generic plastic, I can see exactly where these will break in half, but that won't be hard to fix.
>>Think of it as an upgrade to the old Sony buds and Panasonic ergofits.
>>>You know which iems I kinda miss? The Sony MH1C. Couldn't tell you why. It must've been 8 years since I've heard them. They were a pain to wear, but they sounded so smooth and unfussy (if a little undetailed).
>>>>The YD520s have unusually good detail retrieval (possibly better than the Q1 pro) but also sort of sound "low-def" like the KZ ATE did.
>>>>Very good tuning but probably not the best distortion because of the cheap PET driver. The treble and off gassing plastic stench will probably be a bit much for some people
>>>>
>>>>Similar to KZ, I think Nicehck is best at making cheap single DD earphones that sound better than mainstream Sony, JVC, Phillips et al. They've both beat the "stuff a bunch of random shit in a cable-up IEM" gimmick to death. Time to go back to basics.

## Tripowin Zonie & Final Audio E tips for the Sennheiser IE200 Impressions
*27/08/2025*

>![]()
>My feelings on Tripowin Zonie and Final Audio E (black) tips for IE200. Maybe this'll help someone.
>The Tripowin Zonie is noticeably less microphonic than the stock cable, but still has some rumble when I move my head around. With the higher quality feeling cable comes a lot of extra weight though, and sometimes I'd rather have something lighter like the stock cable. I prefer the Zonie and will keep using it. I had to remove the plastic rings from the cable's MMCX connectors to get it to fit the IE200, which is a massive negative (for the IE200).
>The Final Audio E tips at SS size are almost the same size as the stock silicon tips at S size, so no significant changes in comfort. Isolation is around the same, slightly better at isolating treble than stock. I find it hard to a/b test these accurately, but changes in sound are not drastic at all. There might be slightly more bass. The most important difference, and the reason why I got these tips, is that the treble has improved for my ears. The stock tips had a weird sibilant, thin sound for my ears; S-sounds were harsh, sometimes almost like white noise (a subjective effect, of course). Final Audio E tips made the treble softer, still pronounced, but way nicer. I have the tape mod applied too just in case.
>The under-performing IE200 is very enjoyable with these and I'm glad to finally have an IEM that agrees with my ears.
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/cCKDRS5f/Tripowin-Zonie-Final-Audio-E-tips-for-the-Sennheiser-IE200-Impressions.png)
>>\>The stock tips had a weird sibilant, thin sound for my ears
>>of course it's sibilant lmao ie200 is a horrible sibilant piece of shit
>>and its awful treble is getting boosted by your length mode resonance

## Sennheiser IE200 Impressions
*17/08/2025*

>I actually got the IE200. I had two reasons for doing so -- I found a good deal for them used at a fair price, and they have a small nozzle diameter.
>The smallest stock silicone tips are the only ones that fit my baby ears. If the nozzle was even a millimeter larger in diameter, I doubt it'd fit.
>Sound is good. Nothing compared to my planars yeah, but good. A little hollow. I did the tape mod and took damping foam from another pair of the stock tips and added that to the ones I use for double damping, which slightly reduced some sibilance I was experiencing. Chi-fi at the same price range obviously beats these, but for my circumstances (baby ears) these are very good.
>Isolation is a bit disappointing, but alright enough, better than my closed backs at least. The microphonic cable is the worst part and I'm getting another one ASAP.
>No regrats.

## Crinear Daybreak Impressions
*15-16/08/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/Fs5qyfmG/Crinear-Daybreak-Impressions-1.jpg)
>Finally got daybreak... What can I say? It is pretty good. They are kinda smaller than I expected from all the photos and videos. Very comfortable so if you are fine with semi custom shells or if you find q1pros comfortable these ones should be too.
>Sound quality is as expected. If you are familiar with jm-1 tuning well... that's basically what it is. Nice bass, smooth treble, great mids. Do they sound that different from my vaguely jm-1 tuned SM4s? Not really? But on the other hand I don't really feel the need to fuck with EQ (outside of ear canal resonance).
>Surprisingly standard medium eartips were pretty comfortable but using spring tips just brings comfort to another level. And relaxes treble even more which is nice. Tried triple falange tips too... They made sound very shouty and basically unlistenable for me which is the first time I get such an effect with them lol. I got coffee tips too but they are couple of days away still. Doubt they'll beat spring tips but more tips is always nice.
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/hG5Zfvp5/Crinear-Daybreak-Impressions-2.jpg)
>>Some other pos I have
>
>>Nice review. So what's your favorite pos of those you own? Especially for using outside in noisy environments where you have to turn the volume up.
>>>Probably daybreaks and unironically wyvern black remaster lol Tho they are not as comfortable. I feel like they all mostly isolate the same so experience outside will be similar. For higher volumes something with relaxed treble should be good but literally anything will be fine if you EQ. (Can't say I can recombed wyverns black because I feel that me liking them is a personal thing more than anything)

Comparison with the Wyvern Remaster
>![](https://i.postimg.cc/cCQF9mZF/Crinear-Daybreak-Impressions-3.png)
>lol... Fun fact. I was comparing daybreaks to all my other POS... and wyverns remaster with my usual EQ and coffee tips basically sounded almost the same. I even put daybreak in one ear and wyvern in the other and it didn't feel like I'm wearing 2 different IEMs. Not sure what I was expecting desu...(About my EQ - I wasn't trying to match JM-1 or anything just added a bit more bass, more mids, and was moving treble shelf around until music stopped sounding "muffled". I don't usually lower 3k but did for this comparison). So yeah make of that what you will.

## Kinera Celest Wyvern Remaster Impressions
*14-15/08/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/Px8HqBz1/Kinera-Celest-Wyvern-Remaster-Impressions.jpg)
>Also got the Wyvern Remaster. Excellent comfort, excellent cable, excellent looks, but not so good tuning. The mid treble suckout is real, and you don't even get a sibilance free upper treble. The older non remaster was better tuned but had inferior comfort, accessories and build. I especially like the plastic anime card they included here.
>>\>sibilance free upper treble
>>thing barely has any treble how did you get sibilance there?'
>>>Above 10K. Always get nasty spikes there from 95% of pos. If EQ didn't exist I'd still be a headposser.
>>>>well that sucks for me it's smooth outside of usual mode length resonance... with simple treble shelf shit plays real good
>
>>I almost bought the Qing, then I saw that treble thing, and all of them show that huge dip around 10khz on the graph.
>>It's only really worth it if you are treble sensitive, (I like salnotes zero so I can handle it). The cymbals sound really weird and muffled in most rock songs, the Gate has this problem but probably to a lesser extent. Hopefully the Q1 Pro is better

>>Don't airpods have EQ? Not sure if it's rudimentary like Snoy's, but it should help alot. Personally, as long as whatever device I wear is comfy and has relaxed treble like Faaeal's earbuds, then there's not much to complain about.

## 7Hz Salnotes Zero Impressions
*12/08/2025*

>So it turns out all the people saying these lack bass were using the wrong tips and getting a "partial" seal which lets the Bass and Techs escape.
>
>Once you get them to seal correctly they're pretty much end game level techs and they have a very balanced FR but it sounds almost "digital" like a balanced armature IEM. The cable sucks ass though, I might just use the one off the Gate and leave that one cable-less.
>>ugly shell gives inferior techs
>>>Sort of true, I think the bulky shape is the reason why it is difficult to seal properly.
>>>I don't think I've had any IEM that was this tip-sensitive since the KZ ATE. Where the Gate in particular fits the ear much better but changing the tips doesn't really change the sound.
>
>>\>end game level techs
>>\>almost sounds digital like a BA.

## TempoTec V1 Impressions
*11/08/2025*

>The new Tempotec V1 looks decent, has a moderately smooth UI (given all the limitations), a pretty comprehensive feature set including direct streaming from Tidal/Qobuz, and has half decent output power from balanced out as well.
>
>It's such a shame that the actual sound quality is so... meh. I thought of using it as a transport with the Muse M5 Ultra, but the USB output is noticeably less resolving than my phone (Pixel 9 Pro). There is likely some bit truncation going on that's completely fuzzying up the sound.
>As such, this one goes in the drawer, likely to never see the light of day again. #sigh
>>The balanced port on mine doesn't work. No sound. I contacted support and at first they responded and then they just went quiet on me. Guess I got chinked.
>>Also there is no PEQ, even though it says on their website that it has it.
>
>>What lens and camera did you use btw? Nice bokeh
>
>>\>It's such a shame that the actual sound quality is so... meh.
>>It passes most of the tests perfectly, but jitter is really fucked up for a modern device, also phase is not linear and there are some group delay issues.

## Moondrop Meteor Impressions
*10/08/2025*

>Moondrop meteors blow my $1000 headphones out of the water. I don't know what wizardry they used but they're the single most immersive audio experience I've had, and that's after testing basically every recommended IEM in the market recently.
>In 3 days they basically destroyed all my preconceptions about sound, and for myself I used to value technicalities, now I value emotion. They're probably the first ever pair to be able to draw out the full emotions of a female vocalist, and now my headphones and Q1 just sound veiled on that aspect.
>Another way to describe it is for my whole life, I was listening to music, but now I'm feeling music.

## Moondrop Space Travel 2 Impressions
*07/08/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/NG7LtHN8/Moondrop-Space-Travel-2-Impressions-1.jpg)
>Space Travel 2s came in a week early, posting my thoughts after a day of use. I mostly got these because my 1st gen Airpods finally died and I needed a cheap TWS to replace them.
>
>Build quality is okay, albeit the plastic feels cheap; expected for $25. While the open-top design of the case is admittedly flashy, it's not getting any points in the durability department.
>Fit is decent, slightly on the larger side. You get 3 extra pairs of tips. They aren't as comfortable as the Airpods, but nudging them doesn't cause them to sound like complete shit which is a plus. Note that rolling tips can be a pain because it plays/pauses everytime you touch the thing.
>Sound is passable. Bass is nonexistent, nothing EQ can't fix. I use wireless pos for podcasts and background music when I need my hands free on the go so I'm not paying attention to sound quality, if I want good sound I'll plug in my wired pos.
>Not sure about ANC because people that care about it are faggots who don't want to wear soundproof earmuffs over their pos.
>
>Overall not bad/5. There's probably better TWS pos in the same price range, but how many have a waifu that goes "do do-do" when you turn them on?
>>\>battery life
>>\>anc
>>useless RETARD stop polluting /our/ haven with garbage shit
>>>\>battery life
>>>Been using them for 6 hours straight and still have 1/3 battery left, that should be good for 99% of people
>>>\>anc
>>>It's off

>>Obligatory outdoor closeup of pos because all professional reviews have them and having one automatically makes it professional
>>>ok i was rude, nice color matching
>>>>lol thanks for your kind words anon

>>>Nigga using a steve jobs era iphone

>>\>Bass is nonexistent
>>fucking things barely fit in my ears and I still can hear decent amount of bass lol

## Truthear Gate & Tangzu Wan'er 2 Impressions
*06/08/2025*

>I just received a pair of Truthear Gate and a pair of Tangzu Wan'er SG2 (goated in the OP guide).
>Have just listened to one song on each so far. Initial thoughts:
>Truthear Gate sounds good. Good bass, treble isn't fatiguing. Wan'er 2 however sounds similar to the Simgot EW300, but worse. Bass isn't thumping as much as the Truthear's, but worse of all, it is super sibilant and ear raping. Not a fan at all after 3 minutes of listening to them.
>>Felt the same about waner 1 and to a lesser extent wyvern pro, very shitty nobass sound profile, cant even use this as a casual listen on the go
>
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/vBZ2m9rr/Truthear-Gate-Tangzu-Wan-er-2-Impressions-1.png)
>>Interesting... brighter less bassy pos sounds like less bright and bassier one for you. do you feel like gate has a deeper fit than waner?

## Truthear Pure & Tanchjim 4U Impressions
*04/08/2025*

>Anon from few threads ago asking about the truthear pure here.
>I received mine and am testing it mainly with zts for electro and Frozen Starfall for female vocals. I'm comparing it with my tanchjim 4U in atmo, and I prefer the pure overall for now. I find it richer in sound and slightly more detailed in certain areas. I prefer the bass on the 4U for now, and the female vocals on the 4U are more detailed and prominent.
>The pure is nevertheless more detailed and the sound is richer overall. It's fairly neutral and warm, but less warm than the 4U and a little darker. I don't find it muddy, contrary to what some people say, at least for now. This is my first day listening to it, so I'll test it more throughout the week. Maybe I prefer it for now because it's new.
>I think I'll keep it and switch between it and the 4U depending on what I'm listening to.
>However, I feel like it picks up more ground noise than the 4U. Is that normal ?
>>\>However, I feel like it picks up more ground noise than the 4U. Is that normal ?
>>Is it louder at the same volume? It could just be more sensitive.
>>>I think he pure is at base louder than the 4U so to test it I'm trying to tweak my PC so that the output sound is at the same level.
>>>And yeh tested that way I hear more ground and floor noise with compared to my 4U or ath m50x. I think it's a question of the sensitivity of the iem and the quality of the sound equipment, because I only have a scarlet solo for sound.
>>>It's not really a problem, but it's the first thing I noticed.

## TWS Charging Issue Warning
*03-04/08/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/x1g4VtHd/TWS-Charging-Issue-Warning-1.jpg)
>A word of warning about chinky TWS and possibly all TWS: the contacts will get dirty, and the buds will stop charging. Really annoying, because the buds will stay connected to your phone while in the case while draining battery. I cleaned the contacts on the buds and the case with Q-tips and some IPA, which fixed the problem. Somehow my old ass galaxy buds which I've owned for 3 years now have never had this issue, while I've owned the Mino and Pill for only a few months and they've both developed this problem. I've used the Mino at the gym which may explain it but the Pill hasn't been used for any physical activity.
>>this is part of the reason why wired > wireless
>
>>This constantly happens to me on my Airpods too, very annoying
>
>>how the fuck does that Moondrop one even fit on your ear? I can't tell what I'm looking at
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/FzfPy4n9/TWS-Charging-Issue-Warning-2.jpg)
>>>Like so
>
>>Why would you buy the pill if not to use during physical activity? It inherently has worse sound quality
>>>I bought it because it looks weird. I only use TWS for podcasts/videos so sound is not a concern.
>
>>Just wash yourself. I've been using the same two pairs for months and they still look like brand new.
>
>>try acetone next time

## Kinera Celest Dark Phoenix Impressions
*01/08/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/59nYvzwW/Kinera-Celest-Dark-Phoenix-Impressions.jpg)
>First IEMs, the Celest Dark Phoenix. I have always preferred the in-ear earbuds type, but I don't have good audiophile ears so I just picked something I thought looked cool. I really like the resin shells and they sound good to my ears. I heard a lot of people didn't like the Phoenix Call tuning, but this one is a re-tuned version that's apparently a little bit more relaxed
>>huh.. the tuning of these things...
>>well as long as you like them
>
>>enjoy em. i like them too
>
>>God damn those look sexy as fuck
