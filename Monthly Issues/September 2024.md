>>\>Nah senpai
>>Kinera Thorking, Letshuoer Flagship, FiiO FT1 Headpos, Symphonium Titan, Campfire Trifecta, 64 Audio Solo, Empire Ears Odin, ZiiGaat Estrella
>>I ended up getting *drumroll* The MegaMEME5EST. I couldn't deny the natural FR. Meteor was still the close second, ultimately the EST meme was more sensible than Singaporean 4BA meme, and the treble is better controlled. Verdandi was a cool $400 off MSRP, but still overpriced because Kinera. I think Mega5EST is simply better than Oracle MKIII across the board. Feel free to ask about notes on any of the pos.
>>>\>Final A6000
>>>is it really mid, bro? but the pure beryllium techs...
>>>>Final stuff maintains a general "house sound," as the majority are 1DD. There is a smoothed over creamy cohesiveness about them, but A6000 does have a surprising perception of openness. They are not sensitive, warm balanced, slightly more techs than any of the E or S bullet series, better sub bass and more typical upper mids tuning. For what the TBD expected price will probably be, I would not pay for such a smoothed over 1DD sound, but it is quite pleasant if disregarding price.
>>
>>>what separates good from bad???
>>>>![Anon's SoCal Canjam experience](https://i.postimg.cc/FsH6mpM1/Anon-s-So-Cal-Canjam-experience-2024-3.jpg){width=500} 
>>>>My subjective perception of the overall tonal balance, and good / redeeming qualities versus bad / poor qualities when listening to my set of test tracks.
>>
>>>Is there an IEM you would consider as an upgrade over the Mega5est? Price notwithstanding
>>>>![Anon's SoCal Canjam experience](https://i.postimg.cc/5ynkLQCx/Anon-s-So-Cal-Canjam-experience-2024-4.jpg){width=500} 
>>>>You ask a simple question but there isn't a simple answer imo. Most things are going to diverge as far as frequency response in some region or another. JM-1 meta meme and all that, it's fairly uncommon. The EJ07 successor prototype was solid, afaik it will be 1DD+4BA(?)+4EST, with tuning relatively similar to OG EJ07 which is fairly balanced. ETA release early next year. Nightjar Singularity and Duality are both good as far as retaining a natural timbre and presentation, but are definitely more bass-enhanced sets. As far as Thieaudio's stuff, Monarch MKIII and Origin are my "safe picks," from their ~kilobuck lineup, but they are probably more boosted in the upper mids and treble on average.

## Tanchjim 4U Review
*27/09/2024*

>![Tanchjim 4U Review](https://i.postimg.cc/J7TjGFqC/Tanchjim-4-U-Review-1.jpg){width=400} 
>Sistas...
>4U review coming soon.
>>![Tanchjim 4U Review](https://i.postimg.cc/1526KN2W/Tanchjim-4-U-Review-2.jpg){width=500} 
>>Tanchjim 4U Impressions/Review
>>
>>Build quality is excellent as per usual. Nice shell with no sharp edges, very good (albeit thin) cable that behaves very well, good tips that actually fit the large nozzle, and nice little gifts too. Remains to be seen if the reflective faceplate will ever scratch, but after a week and a half, nothing has appeared.
>>
>>Fit is one of two reasons why I bought this, and it doesn't disappoint. Very nice fitting, and the general size of it allows for very good tip compatibility in terms of comfort and stability. It is a decent bit bigger than the Chu 2, but still much smaller than the average IEM; depending on the tips used, it sits flush inside the ear.
>>>![Tanchjim 4U Review](https://i.postimg.cc/mg99pgGT/Tanchjim-4-U-Review-4.png){width=500} (check archive for full resolution)
>>>Sound quality
>>>
>>>It sounds fine. Not much else to say really, it sounds like any well tuned, competent IEM. The overall tonal balance is very good. Treble is a bit on the spicy side, but nothing major either. Again, not much else to say. Do note that I'm using the stock small wide bore tips, so it is inserted quite deeply.
>>>
>>>The other reason I bought this is for the tuning gimmick, which works surprisingly well. Between the most and second most options, the difference is relatively minor. The third most is significantly different than the previous two, and has a very "earbud" like presentation. The fourth has the least bass, and is too far gone. The issue with both of these last options is that the amount of lost sub bass is not compensated properly with mid bass like it is with earbuds. For most people, the first three options are the only worthwhile ones in my opinion.
>>>
>>>Picrel are the measurements. Distortion is very impressive (no precise values since I haven't calibrated the coupler this time), as well as channel matching: ignore the small difference between channels around 6khz, it is most probably my fault.
>>>>![Tanchjim 4U Review](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbhgr7WF/Tanchjim-4-U-Review-3.jpg){width=400} 
>>>>Finally, for the gazette, a size comparison with the Chu 2.  
>>>>Overall, I like it, but unless you want the tuning gimmick and/or the form factor, there isn't anything special about this.

## FiiO K11 R2R Impressions
*26/09/2024

>![FiiO K11 R2R Impressions](https://i.postimg.cc/mk69JcDg/Fii-O-K11-R2-R-Impressions.jpg){width=600} 
>I’ve spent 2 days with the K11 R2R, short post on its usability:
>\>Temps
>No overheating concerns, the unit barely gets above room temperature as it is.
>\>Gaming latency
>I didn’t hear any discernible audio delay while playing Overwatch and Osu.
>\>Youtube playback
>My Fiio Q15 had an annoying audio sync issue where the first few seconds of any video would be muted. The K11 R2R didn’t have the same problem.
>\>Volume knob
>It’s usable but not the most responsive – sometimes the volume knob wouldn’t register inputs if I button-mashed.
>\>Sound quality
>I was unable to discern any idiosyncrasies in the sound that I could attribute as “R2R”. As for filters, OS mode sounds more transparent, while NOS mode had a slight treble roll-off (reviews interpreted this as sounding “warm”), but honestly, the difference is so insignificant I couldn’t tell the filters apart unless I was switching between them while a track was playing.

## Letshuoer S12 2024 Impressions
*18/09/2024*

>![Letshuoer S12 2024 Impressions](https://i.postimg.cc/zD9KctRk/Letshuoer-S12-2024.jpg){50%:50%} 
>Impressions for S12 2024:
>TL:DR
>It's an Artti T10 sidegrade, S12 planar timbre wasn’t fixed on the 2024 ed
>This is strictly a low/mid-volume set. At higher volumes, S12 2024’s planar timbre is worse than the T10 – cymbals have an unnatural shimmer and wind instruments have a metallic sheen. Also, the S12 2024 is prone to sibilance, so tip-rolling is required. I found DUNU S&S tips to work but foam tips would be better.
>
>Comparisons with Artti T10
>S12 2024 sounds a tad cleaner than the T10 but articulation is sometimes sharpened to the point of harshness. Call it “better techs” if you want, but I’d still choose the T10 because it isn’t as sibilant/painful to listen to. Ultimately both planars sound very similar and any difference is just a nitpicking exercise.
>
>Comparisons with Mega5-EST
>The S12 2024 does sound more detailed than the Mega5est probably since the S12 has a noticeably quicker bass decay which gives it a cleaner midrange and better instrument separation.
>
>New meta IEMs (like the DaVinci, KE4) sound muddy in comparison, but I wouldn’t call the S12 2024 a highly resolving set, since the S12’s excessive "SH" and "S" energy in female vocals can occasionally overpower the treble and cause higher pitch instruments to sound less detailed (masking the shimmer from cymbals and jingle from the tambourine).
>
>Cons
>The set is library/track dependent. Poor fit for jpop/kpop. I want to say instrumentals/classical is fine since I liked Vivaldi on the S12 2024, but it’s a genre with high dynamic range so I’ve had tracks cross into the harshness threshold even on low volume.
>
>inb4 planars are not meant for listening at high volume
>At low volume the S12 2024 is painfully average. But if you crank up the volume to chase “planar techs” you are forced to play a game of tightrope with the volume knob. Why every reviewer praises this golden turd is beyond me.

## Start of the IEM size comparison project
*15/09/2024*

Here are a few exchanges between the editor (me) and others concerning rules. 
>editor here, let me know how everything is going so far.
>the reason for starting this project was very simple: it was a way to record useful posts that had impressions, reviews, measurements and more. the most important thing to me however has been pictures of iems, more precisely semi-standardized images that allow for easier comparisons not only between different iems, but also different people.
>
>the rules so far are as follow:
>- use a lined standard letter format paper for reference. the line orientation is your choice, but keep it to vertical/horizontal only. grid paper is better, in which case specify the grid size
>- include a solid reference for size, such as an apple dongle, a usb c termination, and/or eartips
>- the iems have to be "naked", with no eartips or cables attached (ok for reference). for multiple iems, align them properly, and use the same positions/angles
>- show two important sides: the faceplate size, and the depth of the iem, the latter also showcasing the nozzle size and angle.
>- ensure the photo angle is as vertical as possible to eliminate possible dimension skewing
>- leave a decent margin around the photographed items
>
>picrel is a quick one of the waner, although the photo angle is a bit off as seen with the eartip slanting. it is good enough to show you guys what im expecting. most of the points address proper iem and reference placement and positioning for optimal comparisons. the last point is for my part, where ill be editing cropping/resizing every photo so that when overlaid, the lines of the sheet will match, ensuring high comparability.
>
>i hope many pictures will come in. every iem you have, do them all, even if someone else already posted a pic; the more the merrier!
>>two anon did some in the past
>>>yes as well as a few other pics later on were what inspired me to start this whole thing. the first image is useful but is rather limited for large scale comparison. the second is much better, and although lacking the lined paper background, will still be comparable after i edit them down. thanks for reminding me!
>>>>it's fine at a glance and good on you for wanting to keep track of some stuff, but noobs should not rely on them or (mis)interpret. end of the day people's ears are all different, and without context, people lack the understanding of what "ideal IEM fitment" is... until they have a pair that fits ideally in their particular ears, which is frankly difficult if not impossible to determine from a glance
>>>>>duly noted, ill put a disclaimer for everyone to see.
>>>>>i will however point out that the gazette is really not that popular here, much less for noobs. its nowhere in the op or guides anyway, so the images will most likely be used by experienced users that need to ensure something will be fine for them before purchasing
>
>>I don't think lined paper is all that consistent, and there are two standards, college and wide ruled. Including a known cheap pos is good enough. Which pos to include, let the 'zos duke it out and let's see who comes out on top.
>>>i completely forgot about the two standard thing, fuck
>>>grid paper is probably the better choice then, and should be common enough so that most people hopefully have a spare somewhere

## Gate and EDC Pro comparisons
*14/09/2024*

Two anons share their thoughts on the current FOTM budget IEMs. Which one comes out on top?
>![Gate and EDC Pro comparisons](https://i.postimg.cc/T3df6B4X/Gate-and-EDC-Pro-comparisons-1.jpg){50%:50%} 
>Cheap plastic pos showdown:
>\> Both are passable sound wise
>\> Both are very cheap feeling, EDC pro feels cheaper but also more durable
>\> Comfort is better on the Gate
>\> Cable is better on the Gate
>\> Both are shouty
>\> Upper treble is bad on both but Gate is slightly better
>\> Bass is comparable, maybe slightly stronger on the EDC
>
>Gate is the overall winner, but both aren't that good to be honest. EDC pro is pretty tip sensitive at least in graphs, the starline tips reduces the upper treble spike by a lot on the graph but to my ears it doesn't translate and it's still quite harsh. Spinfit omni fucks up the FR for whatever reason.

## IEMGazette Editor Notes
*08/09/2024*

Exchange between the editor (me) and another anon on the project still in infancy.
>okay so hold on
>cool idea first and foremost, but there is something I have been wondering since anon brought this idea forward
>and that is, what are we going to about the previous impressions and self reviews of various other pos that came before this date, spaning all the way back with each /iemg/ thread? Now obviously we don't have to scour each and every pos that was ever mentioned but we have to at least have to put up the more notable ones into a hall of fame of sorts for posterity's sake
>it will be our very own pos encyclopaedia
>>ok so obviously given the very high activity in this thread, the option of going back through everything is not feasible at all. for now, i will try to go through all the threads that are still alive, but further than that is impossible
>>the plan for now is not set in stone. im not sure if it is better to just keep the rentry as a live thing, where "articles" are consistently added and updated for everyone to see, or if i should do a recurring update (record everything happening in a week, month, quarter, or any time period, and then update it at the end. eg recording everything for september, and then uploading said content at the beginning of october)
>>in both cases, i will have to remove articles, which i plan on doing by simply exporting the pdf/png of the site and storing it online for everyone to look back. as for the original image file, im still debating whether or not i should include them (maybe just for ones that really need it)

Future plans after the update.
>the plan for now is to update it as frequently as i can, which is to say quite frequently (almost daily)
>i got the hang of the formatting for now. since this isn't a purely archival project, i decided that i could change of some of the included posts to better match the formatting (the content itself will NEVER change). this can be seen in the top 3 article where i decided to number each post for consistency.
>ill also be setting up an archive that will contain every picture used and article produced thus far (probably will be separated by month).
>thats it for now, the workflow is pretty optimal. ill check back in a month to see if the schedule, quality, and satisfaction is good or needs improving.
>>nigga this shit ain't gonna last
>>>thats what ill be looking at. i looked back through the last 7-9 threads, and was surprised to find out how little worthwhile content there was (without being that strict with quality), so the "work" is very minimal, and is for the most part sustainable.
>>>if it really is too much, it can just be scrapped (or transferred to someone else if theyre this masochistic) or i can be very strict with the quality and only update here and there.

## Gate and Tempotec Sonata III Impressions
*07/09/2024*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/nc7C5JCx/image.png){30%:30%}
>My first chinkshit arrived a few days ago.
>After testing them, here are my thoughts for anyone considering any of these two. I'm gonna use them mostly on a S22.
>The Tempotec Sonata HD III is quite decent for its price, in some devices, like my laptop, my Switch or low end phones with headphone jacks, it improves the sound and max volume by a LOT, on my desktop PC it's about the same level. Absolutely not a single sound or hissing when nothing is playing or connected. It's built like a tank, very heavy metal frame.
>Conclusion: absolutely recommended.
>The Gatos are, unsurprisingly, what you can expect for 20 freedombucks. They are not bad by any metric, and better than pretty much everything else not chink on this price bracket and maybe a little more. The bass is non existent unless you EQ, then it's kinda there. They are on the brighter side in general, lower treble is good, but when you go higher it shits the bed, also hi-hats sound awful. The mids and vocals are okayish, but very straightforward which I personally like.
>I can't talk about fit because my ear canal is weird and I never had a single in-ear fit in there snuggly. Build materials are just right for something worth $20.
>Conclusion: good bang for the buck, even better if you EQ to your taste, but that applies to everything I guess.
>Thanks for reading my blog, you may unsubscribe now.

## Truthear Nova impressions
*07/09/2027*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/WpG8PQDG/image.png){50%:50%}
>Good evening /iemg/, got my Nova, its a good day.
>Been wanting a pair for a while now. It looks absolutely gorgeous with its deep blue shell. Cable is nice as well, but it is quite microphonic. These fit me perfectly after bending the ear hook a bit because it was wound too tight.
>Turning is very comfortable, zero fatigue, separation is great, fantastic for almost all genres. Playing Pick Up the Pieces by Average White Band, all instruments are given respect, nothing sounds either too thin or bloated, its a joy to listen to.
>The biggest con is that male vocals take a huge hit, and some genres feel exceptionally thin. For example, they cant handle motown. These totally strip away the vocal power of Stevie Wonder or Marvin Gaye. I couldn't fix this with tip rolling.
>In conclusion, beautiful pair with comfortable tuning that's good for most genres except ones focusing on male vocals.

>how's the nozzle? has it destroyed your holes?
>>These nozzles are beastly. I resorted to my dunu tips for fit. But no troubles... yet.

## Conception
*07/09/2024*

Anons discuss a potential blog for keeping track of impressions, measurements, discussions, and more.
>i was just thinking to myself, maybe we should have a scribe retard that documents impressions, measurements, thoughts, and more from /iemg/ into a /blog/. probably one of the more retarded ideas to come up this year, but it does seem fun and somewhat useful especially for all the graphs and shit
>>
>>I like this. Especially impressions and interesting thoughts. The news anon posts are worthwhile too
>
>>the consoom and EQ writeup in the OP is more or less the same thing albeit very slow in getting updates
>>>not really, i'm thinking more along the lines of a blogspot a la sean olive or mr rin choi you know, but with /iemg/ being the authors. the biggest problem is finding someone that is mentally deficient enough to constantly come here, be as unbiased as possible, and maintaining the project

## /iemg/'s top 3 in August
*02/09/2024*

>What are /iemg/'s current rotations looking back on August? Post your top three most used sets.
>1. AFUL MagicOne
>2. NiceHCK YDS
>3. Tanchjim One DSP
>
>>kind of an odd list cause i returned 2 of them for different reasons, but
>>1. Artti R1 - 3DD is interesting, but it had too much bass for me and weird timbre in the treble so i returned it (maybe i had a bad set)
>>2. Sivga Que - actually great refined Blon BL03 style, but had some weird QC issues in the shell that turned me off so i returned it also. (might buy again in the future if they go on sale)
>>3. Ikko OH10 - old reliable fun set with kinda stupid bass but also sometimes hot treble. these always end up my go-to because they fit me really well and i generally like the tuning.
>
>>1. Shozy p20 - Nice slam, thicc warm sound, I robbed linsoul by paying only $70. Different tuning than my harmon and V shaped and I've come to appreciate it
>>2. Wan'er - Replaced my hd6xx for recording music, can't hear shit with the senns when my AC is on
>>3. Space Travels - Use it 6 days a week for physical activity. Yes this is better sounding and more comfortable than the galaxy buds pro 2
>

>>Top three hasn't changed, check archives for impressions:
>>1. Hisenior Mega5-Est
>>2. Ziigaat Cincotres
>>3. Simgot Supermix 4
>>
>>Though I am getting the S12 2024 next week and hoping it's good enough to replace the SM4
>

>>1. EPZ G10
>>2. JBL Endurance Run 2

>>
>>Although I have been opening up a lot of my budget DDs to mess with their tuning.
>>for now i'm saving up for 11.11. maybe i'll finally get a really nice set

## Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and TWS opinions
*02/09/2024*

Anon asks for advice on TWS.
>![Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and TWS opinions](https://i.postimg.cc/m2QjfvF7/Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-2-Pro-and-TWS-opinions.jpg){30%:30%} 
>I have them and they're fucking shit. Poor fit, constantly slipping out if I yawn or smile and thin sound like those shitty wired earbuds we used to get with phones like 15 years ago.
>They came with my phone, and I also had the jabra elite 85ts until one of them fell out at work and I never found it. The jabras were better in every conceivable way, and the only reason one of them fell out was because I was pulling myself up into a roof and my left shoulder brushed up against my ear. They fit well, stayed in at the gym/work, they were comfy, and they sounded good, better than the sony xb700s I had before them. The buds 2 pros are worse than the xb700s were.
>I'm actually going out to buy a pair of xm5s in like an hour because I don't want to keep using the buds 2 pros, I'll let you know if they also suck
>>![Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and TWS opinions](https://i.postimg.cc/MpqDW9yN/Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-2-Pro-and-TWS-opinions-2.jpg){30%:30%} 
>>Updoot: The snoys are alright, the fit isn't quite as good as the 85ts but I haven't tried the other eartips yet. Sound quality is better, but it didn't blow my mind. I kinda wish I got the jabra 10 gen 2s but idk, I kept seeing reviews saying they're worse than previous jabras, and it's not like the xm5s are bad.

## Moondrop Golden Age Failure
*01/09/2024*


>My Golden Ages simply died.
>I received the package like 2 weeks ago, and it's been a great experience, no problems whatsoever. I was listening to some music when the battery went low, after some hours, pretty normal until then. So I put it back to charge and after 2 hours I took them out to listen to some music again but I noticed that there were basically no sound or return from the device. Strange because the charging case i working, blinking the green light etc.
>So I thought, hm maybe the charging case went shit, then I tried to charge the golden ages with the space travel charging case and didn't charged a bit. Strange, so I tried to charge my space travel inside the golden ages charging case and it charged normally.
>So I think my golden ages simply don't get charging anymore. And yes, it's clean, no dirt whatsoever in any hole or connector.
>What should I do now? I don't want to send to China because it will cost more than the earphone itself.

## Noteworthy releases
*01/09/2024*

>New noteworthy release post. A decent amount of releases but I haven't been keeping up with much.
>Price in ($USD with sales*), [driver configuration]
>IEMs:
>\>Shanling MG20 ($40) [1DD]
>Looks fine, no graphs yet.
>\>TinHifi P2 Plus ($530) [1PL]
>Crapshoot in terms of tuning for TinHifi releases. Super expensive so probably bad.
>\>Kiwi Ears KE4 ($200*-230) [2DD + 2BA]
>Very compliant with the new "meta" target.
>\>Kiwi Ears Canta ($90) [1DD + 2PL]
>Not a great looking graph.
>\>INAWAKEN DAWN Ms ($50) [1DD]
>99% sure this is just the Singolo under a new Linsoul company lol.
>\>Tangzu x Dethonray Yu Xuan Ji ($?) [1DD]
>Looks expensive and that shell design is fantastic. Dethonray is a rather niche brand, only having released one pos (10mm planar, Tender 1)
>\>Tangzu Bajie ($600) [1DD + 4BA + 1PZ-BC + 1EST]
>Delayed to September because of overwhelming demand after their demo (their words). Comes included Vortex cable and so many tips (all three >Sancais, and Azla Origins)
>\>Simgot EW300/xHBB/DSP ($70-80) [1DD + 1PL + 1PZ]
>Already been out for a while, do your own research.
>\>Moondrop Ultrasonic ($70) [1DD + 1BA]
>TWS by Moondrop. Seems rather expensive considering the similarities to the Space Travel
>\>Moondrop Block ($70) [1DD]
>Essentially a Space Travel earbud.
>\>Dunu Vivaldi ($40) [1DD]
>Dunu TWS earbuds, go figure.
>\>Xenns Mangird Tea Pro ($360) [2DD + 6BA]
>Graph looks fine, but it is really different from its predecessors (RIP)
>\>HeartField SilverSmith ($500) [1DD + 2BA] & Silberia ($400) [1DD + 2BA + 1MEM]
>Seems interesting.
>\>LimeEars pos
>Seems like a new brand, and wow are they expensive.
>\>"Obscure" brands (INTUAURA, CKLVX, PULA, NiceHCK, Raptgo, XINHS, QoA, Tiandirenhe, LUN SHENG, FLOAUDIO, Kefine, etc)
>I can't do it for all of them, sorry :(
>\>TRN, KZ, CCA, CVJ, NiceHCK, FiiO, etc
>You know the drill, not posting any of these. As always, beware of KZ/CCA stealth revisions.

>DAC/Amps/Accessories
>\>Kiwi Ears Allegro Mini
>Novel form factor
>\>Tanchjim Cable X
>Looks interesting. Hopefully better than Moondrop's DSP cable implementations.
>\>Tanchjim Luna
>Again, nothing particularly worthwhile, but damn does it look good. APx555 measurements show excellent performance.
>\>Fiio BTR13
>Looks great, and could be the Q5K replacement everybody's been waiting for. Good BT codec support, good DAC chips, and decent PEQ implementation. Battery on other models in the same family has been lackluster.
>\>Too many dongle DAC/amps
>Not listing all of them. A lot of CS43131 being used, and they're getting cheaper and cheaper.

>News and events:
>\>Nothing new really.
>\>New paper (Harman - Sean Olive) on 5128 targets coming this AES convention in October.
