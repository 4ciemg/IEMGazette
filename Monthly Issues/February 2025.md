## Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions
*13/02/2025*


>![Eletech / Jomo Audio Mass Impressions](https://i.postimg.cc/jd4j9K5r/Eletech-Jomo-Audio-Mass-Impressions-1.png)
>Went to Eletech/Jomo Audio HQ today and demoed some pos:
>
>\>Ame Mousa
>Very warm with tamed treble. Good subbass. No risk of sibilance. Noteweight is overly thick – string and wind instruments are too sweet and lacks proper air. Cymbals and triangle get overwhelmed by midrange instruments due to a lack of treble extension. Warmfi sets with some sparkle (like the Alter Ego/VE10) are more my taste but I could consider the Mousa as a “better” UM Multiverse Mentor. Mousa is just too relaxing for me. 7/10.
>
>\>MMR Gáe Bolg
>A five-year-old set. Too lean with disgusting Harman timbre. Female vocals sound veiled. Very low res, this set did not age well. I don’t know what’s going on with the squigs the Gaebolg sounds nothing like that. Even a $20 pos is better. 1/10.
>
>\>Canpur CP54E
>Thick lower mids with nice treble and air. Maybe the low-end is too boosted because female vocals sound drowned out at times. A 1k to 3k boost would help immensely because currently the Canpur doesn’t sound cohesive – I just get a lot of midbass and treble. If you only listened to male vocals you’d probably think this set is incredible. 5/10.
>
>\>Canpur CP32E
>A brighter CP54E. Sounds eerily similar to the Supermix 4 albeit with good ESTs implementation. Wide-bore tips are a must. 7/10.
>
>\>Jomo Audio Nautilus
>A vocal-centric V shape tuning. Sounds exactly like the squigs. Hefty low-end gives nice noteweight and timbre, coupled with a boosted pinna to bring female vocals to the forefront. It’s like a cheaper VE10 and just as resolving. Super underrated jpop/kpop set, I’ve heard other meme “vocals” set like the Diva, Verdandi, Supernova and I think the Nautilus mogs all of them. 10/10, bought it on the spot.

## Softears Volume S Impressions & Comparison
*12/02/2025*

>Got the Volume S after returning a set of Performer7. The subbass is there for me until it goes to 40hz. Most of my music doesn't go that low but I do notice when rumble is missing on songs that have it. It can vibrate down to 1hz on a tone generator if I raise the volume, so maybe it's fixable with EQ. I thought the 10dB pinna gain was going to hurt me but it only gives some bite to guitars. Like the tryout anon said, the midbass is a little muddy and some vocals can sound veiled despite the pinna gain. It's song dependent.
>
>That said, this IEM does give the feeling of "soundstage". It doesn't expand past your head or anything. What I mean is there is some extra space between instruments when they're being played at the same time. Some hybrid IEMs like the P7 have good layering but they just blast everything to your ears and it's overwhelming. The positional imaging is good for games. One thing I hated about the P7 was that panning sounds would quickly snap from one side to the other and barely touch the center. The Volume S does it normally I guess. Since the EPZ P50 graphs like the Volume S but has planars like the P7 I wonder if it has this same issue.
>>Everybody is sucking off volume S so much but if it fucks up female vocals it's a dealbreaker for me... Also it's kinda understandable cause for example dude from headphones.com doesn't even have tracks with female vocals in his "test rack playlist". How the fuck is he reviewing shit then LOL

>behold peak iem design
>>what in the actual fuck.
>
>>honestly great, the two dove iems actually measure well and look unique
>>>Any more info on these?
>>>>woodenears has measurements for these, the one in pic is a er4 clone, the other is a decently well tuned tunable pos
>>>>>Thanks, those both actually look fairly good. Wonder how they stack up against the ER2SE.

## Moondrop Echo A Impressions
*07-08/02/2025*

>![Moondrop Echo A Impressions](https://i.postimg.cc/8chCTgmM/Moondrop-Echo-A-Impressions.jpg){width=400}
>impulse bought the new moondrop dongle
>surprisingly has no hiss so that makes it better than every other dongle under $30
>who knows how long it will last though. moondrop clicks only were good for a week before breaking. the JA11s ive had only lasted around a month of daily use.
>>have you tried the jcally jm20?
>>>i have not personally had a great time with jcally dacs in the past but maybe ill check it out in the next major ali sale
>>>desu the biggest things that matter to me in a dongle is inaudible noise floor and durability. i know that at some point i should just get a q5x instead of dealing with these shits because the failure point is always strain relief area when in a pocket.
>>>>same, most jcally dacs have been bad for me but if it's using the cs43131 hopefully the retards there can do a semi-decent job at implementing it
>>
>>>\> jcally jm20
>>>outdated meme
>>>moonshit echo-a/b have dsp (different apps to eq, lmao)
>>>>pretty sure echo a has no dsp
>>>>also
>>>>\>moondropped dsp
>>>>lmao
>>>
>>>>\>moonshit echo-a/b have dsp (different apps to eq, lmao)
>>>>only the echo-b supports DSP and it's 4.4mm so it's a pos
>>>>>\> pretty sure echo a has no dsp
>>>>>Echo-A use CB1200-AU DAC chip (like the quarks 2) so you need to use chinkshit TTGK "Walk Play" app to fix
>>>>>>\>$20
>>>>>>yeah i'll just get a generic cb1200au instead
>
>>\>new moondrop dongle
>>For some reason I have faith that Echo A/B and the new Softears dong are finally decent implemented tail dongles. Praying your ears don't get BTFO'd by random tones.
>>>yeah did not expect to be immediately wowed by the echo after their history of dacs. if this does not shit out then i would look forward to a freedsp 2. if it does then i know shenzhen got me because they replaced and eventually refunded my click without question.

>>expensive iem are retard tax

>>imagine not knowing about reshelling service and custom shell universal IEMs
>>>then i have to also replace the cable because it looks like ass! at this point i might just fucking build them myself

## Kiwi Ears Cadenza Impressions
*04-05/02/2025*

>\>Moondrop Aria paint is completely flaked off, plastic starting to wear down, generally unpleasent
>\>Order Kiwi Ears Cadenza as replacement
>\>The red ones arrive in a bright pink
>
>Thank god I'm only using those at home. Still hella gay.
>>show pics
>>>![Kiwi Ears Cadenza Impressions](https://i.postimg.cc/qMstTy1S/Kiwi-Ears-Cadenza-Impressions.jpg){width=400}
>>>Ignore my dusty ass workspace, I'm barely in here anymore.
>>>But yeah, that's not red in any sense of the word.
>>>So far, they sound like a step down from the OG arias but I need to throw more shit against them to see how I like them, I guess. Only listened to maybe 20 minutes of music so far.
>>>>Curious to hear more thoughts on these. They seem like an ideal solution for me. Tuning similar to the Zero2, but not an enormous shell
>>>>>they're fucking shit
>>>>
>>>>>\>not an enormous shell
>>>>>newfriend... cadenza shell is far from ideal ergonomics and shape. epz q1 pro, tkzk ouranos, etc. all have better contoured and slimmer shape
>>>>>>I have Q1 Pros already. Surely Cadenza are closer to those than the Zero2?
>>>>>>>\>already have decent budget 1DD and still want to buy another
>>>>>>>guy.... just eq. no, as i already stated, cadenza's shell shape is far from ideal. fatter than q1 pro with a worse nozzle design
>>>>>>>>I do EQ the Q1s are happy with them. I keep them at my office and like having a second set to keep at home, plus having variety is nice.
>>>>>>>>If the Cadenza isn't any comfier than the Zero2, I'll probably hold off another pos until there's some more budget stuff with the "meta" tuning, since that aligns pretty close to my preferences.
>>>>
>>>>>I certainly wasn't prepared for the amount of treble in these, lead me to a somewhat "tinny" first impression. But that might also be me not being used to a V shaped tuning, coming from the Arias. They are very comfortable though, more so than the Aria.
>>>
>>>>Alright, after listening to those some more I'm probably going to return them. While they're described as warm, I find them way too bright. The treble is too much for me, doesn't fit with the music I'm listening to, at all. They seem to have "broken in" somewhat, or my ears got more used to it, but it's still very distracting.
>>>>Since the Aria 2 have the same paint chipping problem (what the fuck, moondrop), I have no idea what to get for a warm pair of IEMs with some understated treble, much like I feel the Aria have been.

>>LMAO fell for the meme, what's so ass about them
>>>Can't play subbass, can't stay in my ears, basically unusable. Left earpiece has higher distortion.

>>>>>I already have everything else.
