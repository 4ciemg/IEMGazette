## KZ Saga Measurements (n=6)
*29/10/2024*

>![KZ Saga Measurements (n=6)](https://i.postimg.cc/rpTjY6WT/KZ-Saga-Measurements-n-6-1.jpg){width=500}
>Guess how many units were good.

>>![KZ Saga Measurements (n=6)](https://i.postimg.cc/RZKGRCWG/KZ-Saga-Measurements-n-6-2.png){width=500}
>>Graphs for these shits here. All measurements were done using JVC Spiral Dots++ tips and an aftermarket 4.4mm cable. Source is the Tanchjim Luna weeb edition, all units were measured at the same volume and then offset in REW to make the graph more readable. Samples 2-6 were ordered roughly 2-3 weeks ago, sample 1 was ordered roughly a month ago. Samples 2-6 were purchased across various Aliexpress stores, with sample 1 coming direct from KZ.
>>Samples 3 and 6 have acceptable channel balance but sample 5 is the only one I'd call good. Sample 1 is bad, sample 2 is almost okay, and sample 4 is awful. Depending on your standards, 50% to 66% of units are decent. I understand why crapzo bought a bunch of CRAs, it's the only way to guarantee you get a good pair. Mixing and matching gave me one "golden" pair, the left channel from sample 3 and the right channel from sample 6.
>>Other stuff about the IEM, the build is incredibly solid, not just for the price. It's all metal and the comfort is better than every other KZ I've tried. The shell is just as nice as the EA500LM shell, slightly more comfortable and I think it looks better too. The build was the reason I decided to do this experiment, I figured I'd spend about as much as the EA500LM to see if I could get a good pair after the first pair I ordered ended up having not so great channel matching. Sound wise the Saga is decently bassy, with an irritating spike at 11.3K to my ears and slightly muddy lower mids but otherwise not really deficient in any other area. The ear gain and treble are still a few dB too much for my taste but that's a matter of preference. I can't recommend KZ unless you have your own coupler and are willing to buy roll the dice on multiple units to do the QC yourself. The stock cable is also an abomination as expected. This was fun though, and I'm happy with the results.

## TRN MT5 Review
*23-25/10/2024*

>![TRN MT5 Review](https://i.postimg.cc/WbkfcGgW/TRN-MT5-Review-1.png){width=500}
>Ok here's a flash review of the TRN MT5 after using it for 3 days (too lazy to set up a photo shoot, maybe later).
>
>Fit/Comfort: Good, lightweight shell that is thinner than average but not by much, with a short nozzle that has a weird stub on it (instead of a "hard" lip). Haven't had any major clogging issues but I'm not confident . Looks nice and plain.
>
>Sound: Surprisingly good. Using tips for deep insertion; treble is relatively smooth, maybe a minor peak here and there. Not missing much in terms of treble information/resolution, but I'll check thoroughly later. This actually reminds me of the Wan'er but with more treble. While bass seems to be more, it is very lacking and needs a sub bass boost to bring back some rumble and body. Channel matching is good (the very small imbalance in sub bass is not really noticeable), distortion is also far from an issue.
>
>Conclusion: It's good, really good. I'm not spending too much time on this because it's just another IEM that performs well, but it is commendable that a well-built, comfortable, and good sounding IEM can be had for around $5. I'm keeping these in my rotation for a while and will update if there's anything new that pops up.
>>Nice man. looks like it graphs very similar to the orca. I was always on the edge of copping that setâ€¦i might do so now it looks better than orca aesthetically
>>>Basically the same looking at other measurements. I was actually tempted by the Orcas a while back but was put off by the looks just like you.
>
>>![TRN MT5 Review](https://i.postimg.cc/FFqn6Wdk/TRN-MT5-Review-2.jpg){width=500}
>>Where's the advertised LCP DD lol
>>>Didn't realize they advertised it as LCP, that's weird.
>
>>Ok so I tested it out a lot more thoroughly, and man I'm impressed.
>>First thing I did was change tips. I ended up on something with shallower insertion depth, but with much better seal, which in turn improved the bass drastically; a small sub bass boost is still nice but far from necessary now. The previous tips were very comfortable, but any small jaw movement would ever so slightly break the seal.
>>
>>As for EQ, I didn't do much, just a very small bump around 10khz just to increase resolution. Everything seems to match my hearing perfectly, I'm rather surprised.
>>
>>Compared to other 1DD in terms of sound quality, it is excellent to my ears, and I wouldn't be mad if this was the only IEM I could use from now on.
>>>![TRN MT5 Review](https://i.postimg.cc/6qDjGqJf/TRN-MT5-Review-3.png){width=500}
>>>And here are the results from a bit of quick modding.
>>>Seems like foams are ideal for that 5khz peak in case it is too prominent on some units. Didn't notice a huge difference there. However, it seems like the front vent is dropping a good amount of bass. Haven't listened to this last one as the vent blocking was due to the coupler pressing against the tip dome/umbrella and covering the vent. Becomes a bit uncontrolled and has some driver flex and pressure issue. Maybe a light filter will work.

## Lepic Nuon Clears and Coreir Al Tips Impressions and Measurements
*22-23/10/2024*

>New Japanese tips, got the Lepic (le epic xDD) Nuon Clears and the new Coreir AL. The Nuons are comfortable, but very small bore. The surface isn't grippy and the stem is relatively stiff but the shape lets it go deep without discomfort.
>The Coreir ALs are just more of the same as the brass version, I gave my Simgots to my parents so I'm not sure what to put them on. I'm also looking for more esoteric Japanese tips, I'm getting a zenmarket haul soon so might as well grab some small items since the shipping is gonna be the same either way.
>>Small bore is good though nah?
>>>I'll graph it later on the gate, initial impressions it sounds maybe a bit muted in the upper treble on U18s compared to W1.

>>>Yeah I was the anon who bought them a while back. They are pretty much a meme, but they change the sound a lot. I'm sure there's something out there that would sound good with them, but they'll ruin any competently tuned pos for sure.
>>>>You still like them Origins?
>>>>>Yeah origins are great. Still my go to cheap DD.

>![Lepic Nuon Clears and Coreir Al tips impressions and measurements](https://i.postimg.cc/G2mSW6xG/Lepic-Nuon-Clears-and-Coreir-Al-tips-impressions-and-measurements-4.png){width=500}
>Measured the Nuon Clear and Coreir tips on Gate. They're both in the "tips that change the sound" category. I noticed the Coreirs measure very similarly to the Softears Ultraclears which are slightly narrower bore and obviously don't have the metal insert. The Nuons don't measure like any of the other tips which were omitted.
>
>I averaged all the standard wide bore tips that measure nearly identically in this graph to declutter things, that includes the Sancai Wide Bore, Spiral Dots++, Divinus Velvet, Feaulle H570, and the stock tips that came with the Gate.

## Fosi DS2 Issue
*21/10/2024*

>I recently bought a fosi audio ds2 and it was working great as recently as last night. Today I wake up and plug it in and it no longer works. The LED lights up blue (I think it used to light up red), so it is receiving power, but no matter what headphone or input it doesn't transmit audio. I've tried the volume buttons, switching between high and low mode (nothing happens), and plugging it into a pc (no device is recognized). I assume it's broken, I bought it on Amazon so I can get a replacement, but is there anything else I should try before I do that? Is this a known issue with the device?

## Truthear Gate Impressions
*19/10/2024*
>Just got some gatos today and listened to my usual shit for a few hours. I doubt burn-in really applies here but they were pretty shit as expected.
>\>positives
>extremely light weight, no fatigue, no leak, good fit, good cable, decent carry case
>\>negatives
>non-existent bass, no sound stage, zero isolation, and everything sounds muffled so you need to raise usual listening volume to sound "normal"
>For reference I compared these to my og starfields and genuinely can't find a single aspect that's better outside of frame weight. That said, for how cheap these are they aren't that bad. The cable feels much better than moondrop's shit too. I could see myself using them on occasion even, maybe at the gym or on a plane.

## FiiO HS20 Impressions
*19/10/2024* 
>Got my FiiO HS20's for my Chu 2's, and they definitely sit better in my ears than the stock tips, they actually stick and don't slip out. Plus now I will know when they'll start to oxidize again. They're also much less springy and it seems that I have to use the M size and insert them deep for them to properly seal. At this point I believe my issue is that I don't know how to insert them properly, I'll keep fiddling with them until I get the right amount of bass and by doing so I scratch my ear with the nozzle and then it hurts. I'd get the Spring Tips to try out next if Moondrop offered a variety pack of them like FiiO did, shit's too finicky to just blind buy one size.
>
>I'm still thinking about getting the EPZ Q1 Pro's on 11.11, but now I'm thinking whether or not I should be on the lookout for other cheapo shit around that price point to try and get for a bargain once the sale starts. Or other cheap chinkshit in general. It'd be nice if the fox IEM guy weighed in on how he maintains them.

>>>
>>>\>Sliivo Sl41 MK2
>>>Some reviewer said the color is blacker irl than on the images, which I was hoping for, but is not true. Cable is great. Good sound. A lot of separation and details that I didn't notice before. I'm not sure if it's a treble monster or not though. I hear a lot of percussion. Kick drums are also quite strong. I tried AutoEQ and applied the Harman target one. Took care of the treble but the sound is now a bit boring and also too familiar. That's how I have my headphones EQ'd after all and I immediately recognized the signature. I'm not sure if I should take the EQ out and just enjoy the different sound.
>>>\>Divinus Velvet
>>>These are scam. Gaping my ear holes. Short and wide. Can't use them.
>>>\>Dunu S&S
>>>Smallest size fits nicely I think. Gotta use them for longer but I might stick with them, unless there are other recs I can try for small ears.
>>>\>FiiO KA15
>>>This is great but as you'd expect the app is garbage. The KA15 isn't even listed as a device in there. I can't use it all with the app. Not sure how reviewers can. Maybe it's because I'm not letting the app access my location and device listening or whatever? Then again they shouldn't need that for a fucking dongle DAC. The KA15 isn't in the list when you try to add a device manually anyways.
>>>
>>>So fuck the app, but has any FiiO drone used the website control page with the EQ? It connects and I updated the firmware, but I can't save EQ settings. Anyone know how this shit works?
>>
>>>where did you buy this from? which site?
>>>also, out of these two, which tips do you prefer?
>>>>I saw hifigo in the OP so I just tried that. Didn't get charged for customs somehow in yurop and shipping was rather quick. Divinus gape my ears. I can't wear them. S&S are good. I saw some reviewer say they mold to your ear canal's shape somewhat with time. I think I'd prefer the shape of something like [AE100 / FiiO HS200 tips] though.

## Westone Mach 70 Impressions
*17/10/2024*

>I got my Westone Mach 70s yesterday in the mail. The sound's well-rounded, kind of like the signature Peenon offers: Rich mid bass, veiled treble. It sounds lovely, but It's a subtle upgrade to my EPZ G10s. Thankfully channel balance is near perfect, but my unit measures with less treble than VSG's, with mine dropping around 14khz.

## Tanchjim Filter, or just a 500 mesh filter?

>Don't know if this is common knowledge, but just wanted to let you guys know that whatever filter Tanchjim is using on the 4U (and I'm assuming on most of their other IEMs) is simply a 500 mesh filter.
>I remeasured since I felt like they had gotten a bit darker with a subtle ear gain shift; lo and behold, it seems like the effects of the filter enhanced themselves (due to uncleanable clogging/condensation?), reducing the ear gain even more.
>Swapping for a 500 mesh filter, which looks identical apart for the surrounding glue, brought it back to its original tuning. I will however say that I'm keeping the old filters, since the more relaxed tuning fits how I use it (long periods because it's so damn comfortable). One EQ filter is enough to "fix it" if needed.

## Truthear Gate Tip Rolling Measurements
*06/10/2024*

>![Truthear Gate Tip Rolling Measurements](https://i.postimg.cc/7YJKHPfb/Truthear-Gate-Tip-Rolling-Measurements.png){width=500}
>I measured some tips on the Truthear Gate.
>Tips seem to generally fall into two groups, tips that barely change the sound at all and tips that do change the sound. Sancai Wide Bore, Spiral Dots, Velvet, and H570 all measured almost identically, with only minor differences above 6K.
>The second group of tips are the W1, Flex, and Ultraclears, and they all graph differently to each other and the first group of tips. I'm surprised to see upper mids being affected, I had always assumed tips really only differed above 10K but these graphs suggest tip choices don't matter at all until they do. The changes below 10K are 1-2dB at most but this might be audible. I'm guessing bore diameter is a significant factor, all 3 'abnormal' tips are narrower bore than all the 'normal' tips and the Flex and W1 have bendy heads.
>In other words, use wide bore tips with single DD pos unless you have a measurement rig, it'll make EQ easier. Conventional knowledge that wide bore = more treble is not always true, consider that myth deboonked.

## ISN Audio H60 Review
*04/10/2024*

>![ISN Audio H60 Review](https://i.postimg.cc/02S4frWs/ISN-Audio-H60-Review-1.jpg){width=500} 
>-Been collecting IEMs for three years
>-Have only been collecting cheap pos and some that are slightly above them
>-Most expensive models I have are Truthear Zero: Red, Tinhifi T3 Plus and TRN BA5
>-Quite a number of KZs, mostly for everyday use at work
>-Decided to move on to higher tier pos (kilobuck in local currency) after saving up some money
>-Look at some models: Dunu DaVinci, Thieaudio Hype 4, Ziigaat Doscinco/Cincotres, Ziigaat Arete, Moondrop Blessing 3
>-Then at some pricier models, like Xenns Mangird Top, Simgot EM10, Dunu SA6 MK2
>-Then at some more obscure ones like Sliivo SL41 MK2, Sliivo SLT-6, Letshuoer Cadenza 4
>-Browsing AliExpress, came across Penon Audio, they've got a lot of "more obscure" IEMs with lots of positive feedback
>-Penon, ISN Audio, Sound Rhyme, Tansio Mirai, Paiaudio
>-Came across the ISN Audio H60
>-Reviewed very positively everywhere I look
>-Specs look nice: 2DD 4BA, 2 Sonion BAs for mids, 2 Knowles BA for highs
>-$350
>-Purchased directly from Penon store, because I can also get a free gift of my choice, which is a free IEM
>-Just a cheap pair of Sennheiser Momentum knockoffs, actually sounds good for what they are, but let's not talk about them.
>>![ISN Audio H60 Review](https://i.postimg.cc/9QtN6KHg/ISN-Audio-H60-Review-2.jpg){width=500} 
>>-2DD 4BA
>>-All resin build with nozzles that put the Zero: Reds to shame
>>-Sounds incredible, with present but not too overbearing bass that thumps when you push it
>>-Treble can be screechy at higher volumes, but sounds nice when you're not blasting tons of volume
>>-Mids are pleasant, but vocals can sound further back compared to other sets I have
>>-Linkin Park sounds so good through this set, so does rock and metal but other genres are good too
>>-No switches, you get one sound profile out of the box
>>-Depending on the recording, can feel the space and reasonable amount of detail, above my older cheaper sets
>>-Haven't played with EQ because I'm lazy, but this set probably responds to EQ quite well because of how it responds to BASS ON on my old Fiio E10K
>>-Overall sounds beautiful, I can't find myself returning to the T3 Plus even though they're my favourite sets after the EPZ Q1 Pro
>>>![ISN Audio H60 Review](https://i.postimg.cc/nhtPwZgQ/ISN-Audio-H60-Review-3.jpg){width=500} 
>>>-ISN Audio uses the exact same box for every IEM they sell, the only difference is the sticker they stuck on the box to tell them what IEM is inside
>>>-No waifus to be found
>>>-The H60 comes with three sets of tips that I proceed to put aside for custom tips, a not-so-appealing orange cable with no ear hooks, a nice little hard leather pouch and a small brush with a metal tip to fix the IEM filter
>>>-You'll be tip rolling a lot, because despite ergonomic shell with decent comfort, sound does get more affected depending on what tips you use
>>>-Ended up with the Spinfit W1 in MS, improved the soundstage and unlikely to come off as easily as many tips I tried, including Dunu S&S tips
>>>-Cable rolling will also be a challenge because the 2-pin connector is not very snug, even with 0.78mm pins, had to use tiny paper strips to ensure a more snug fit
>>>-Ended up with cheap Xinhs cable that can stay on longer and of very good quality
>>>-Spinfit W1 is the final piece of the puzzle, now I have my best sounding set in my collection
>>>-Score 4.8/5, highly recommended, will try out another Penon Audio IEM in the future
>>>>-KiwiEars KE4 and Xenns Mangird Tea Pro came out after I got the H60. I regret nothing.

## Shure SE425 Impressions
*03/10/2024*

>![Shure SE425 Impressions](https://i.postimg.cc/fycx34K6/Shure-SE425-Impressions.png){width=500} 
>I thought Shure only made shit but I bought a (legit) pair of Se425s and I really don't hate it. Definitely needed a lift in the entire treble region (Used a HS @5000hz, Q1, 5db) and now it's very enjoyable. I'll post a graph of the stock response after work.
>>Here it is with how I EQ it too. Kind of weird how "flat" Se425 measures at the beginning and yes, the stock treble response is atrocious and anyone who doesn't suffer hearing loss will notice it going 'missing.'
>>Just a note: the target only displays my Ear gain preference, but even with that considered, the warmth of these really carries the lack of sub bass, though, I do not listen to much EDM at the moment, or any music that demands much rumble, so I myself don't notice the absence when listening.

## Discussion with other anons
*02/10/2024*

Editor (me) and anon discuss on solutions and alternatives to current project implementations.

>\>Does anyone have the squig.link scrape?
>will be soon in the gazette archive, just have to do a few more things
>https://rentry.org/iemgazette#iemgazette-archive
>>\>mega.nz
>>Please no. Torrent, syncthing, send.vis.ee instances, selfhost, but not that shit.
>>\>squig.link scrape
>>everything worthy (evaluated by jaako) is already in the autoeq DB. Can create a short guide if needed.
>>It'd be better to scrape crinacle. I think i already added his patreon to kemono, and there was a browser script for scraping that was shared years ago and still works.
>>Now that i think about it, we should we selfhost our own wiki as well as some useful services such as squig, volume calculator, pinnacle of sound/piece of shit lists, knowledge base etc.
>>>im open to any of that, but unless people actually get to doing it, ill stick with this flawed but simple solution (i still have everything stored locally for future projects)
>>>as for crinacle's database, not sure if that still works considering he changed a lot recently.
>>>>I'll start putting things together in a month or so. You do you.

>>>>>\>I'll start putting things together in a month or so.

## Simgot Supermix4 and Moondrop Space Travel Review
*01/10/2024*

>2 weeks review of
>\>Supermix 4
>\>Space Travels
>Use the SM4 at the desk at work and at home
>Use the ST during commutes and outdoor exercising.
>The SM4 is pretty good for 150$. The techs are good, the sound is nice and with some EQ you can prevent tinnitus at 5k. They are on the smaller size of iems and should fit for most people with small-mid sized ears.
>The ST can be used without the dogshit app. The ANC only works for background noise, not stuff like cars going by or leaves rustling thanks to windforce 7 winds.
>ANC should be turned off while windy outside or enjoy your deafzo experience because it somehow boosts the sound of the wind.
>Tuning is good enough for me to not care about EQ
>Battery is good enough
>The sound quality is better than last gen airpods. But still gets owned by any 20 dollar or above iem.
>Needs proper tips.
