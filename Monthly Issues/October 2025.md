>\>ok wanna upgrade nyao
>\>buy Zero RED because it's twice the price and should be twice the performance
>\>mfw Zero RED tuned like muffled compressed garbage
>\>mfw Zero RED distorts at higher volumes on my dac amp... volumes my Chu 2 can easily clear
>\>mfw never trusting CrinACKle ever again.

## Tanchjim Origin Impressions
*28-29/10/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/VNGpnDLD/Tanchjim-Origin-Impressions.jpg)
>\>Run a 1DD,2BA/side IEM config for multiple years, love it
>\>Newer, larger 1DD/side IEM pair with lower THD arrives today, love it
>The DD> slam. The resolution with lower THD. Damn, I like the Origins. I think I get why a lot of people like single DD IEMs now. I'm noticing nice little bumps in resolution/texture from the low THD, and that bit of extra DD slam makes it feel more engaging without being muddy bass V-curve bullshit. Hard to explain (maybe it's the subbass?), but it's just very good overall.
>
>On that note, I did some A-B testing with the tuning nozzles as well as some tip rolling. Settled on Softears UCs and L nozzles like another anon who responded to me in this gen some several days back. The air and resolution are just really satisfying. My only gripe is that I need Large tips over Mediums like I have now for better seal. I may shell out needlessly for Softears UTs in Large, not sure yet.
>\>Pic rel, the IEMs.
>>driver configuration doesn't matter
>>when will you learn
>
>>\>I'm noticing nice little bumps in resolution/texture from the low THD
>>proof that even 1dd fags are retarded
>>>not true, just tanchjim owners
>
>>\>regular boring Origin
>>Should have bought the Lost Manor edition.
>>Loser.
>
>>Chu 2 has lower THD than origin. What you're actually hearing is tanchjim 11kHz ear rape. Because resolution is ear rape.

## Knockoff Sennheiser IE900 Review
*27/10/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/k5Kqy0L3/Knockoff-Sennheiser-IE900-Review.png)
>bought a 45usd knockoff shenzhenheiser ie900 from taobao and cracked it open/measured with a cheapo 60318 coupler. picrel's red/blue lines are random raw measurement i took from the web and green/yellow are the measurement of the fake one i bought that i tried to align the ear canal resonance with the genuine one's graph.
>seller said it uses momentum's xwb driver and it turned out to be true when i opened it to fix the poorly installed bass damper on the left side
>also unlike the original it had some earwax filter below the weird star shaped mesh and removing it made the graph closer to the real one
>
>sound-wise i think it's very pleasing
>vocal is extremely backed, lower bass is pronounced and the staging is extremely good for me
>though i can't tell if it's same or not for the genuine ie900
>any thoughts?
>>It's not the same as original but the original is not good in the first place. And you had to disassemble and fix that shitty bootleg. Pray that ikea effect won't wear off too soon.
>>>to be fair i poked the tuning hole for no literal reason peeling the damper sticker off inside out lmao so it didnt need servicing w/o my adhd mental retardation
>>>i'm a gook and this general reminds me of a local bbs where only graphs mattered

## Ziigaat Doscinco Impressions
*20/10/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/c4x7GZcf/Ziigaat-Doscinco-Impressions.png)
>Received the Ziigaat Doscinco today. Been listening to it for about 30 minutes using various tips. So far I am quite disappointed.
>
>\> What don't I like about them?
>First of all, the sound is very V-shaped. Lots of bass but also lots of upper mids/ear gain. Everything sounds sibilant to me. I have to turn down the volume a lot. Voices, pianos, guitars etc are too quiet.
>
>It also seems like they don't fit into my ears well. The nozzles are very short so they sit far out on the ears.
>
>I made a quick and simple EQ to get it closer to the Aful Explorer. But even with this on it doesn't sound that good. I still prefer the Explorers.
>>You should keep in mind quality assurance and unit variation. You are looking at a graph of someone else's unit from some time ago.
>>Linsoul's brands unfortunately have had a bit of a down-slide as far as how well-matched and consistent their models are (at all prices, Doscinco up to Thieaudio Monarch level). Your unit may very well graph quite different from what you see there, which further confounds what you are hearing. Keep that in mind. (It's not that graphs "lie." We lack certainty of how both your Explorer and Doscinco graph).
>>\>fit
>>Well now you know how virtually every ZiiGaat fits, they use the exact same shape for most resin hybrid models FYI. Not a good shell for me either.
>>>Thanks for the info. I guess Ill try to sell this.

## KZ ZS12 Pro Impressions
*15/10/2025*

>So far I'm digging how rob zombie sounds on it.. the KZ ZS12x that is.
>I like the two low swtiches down and two high switches up.

>On the KZ ZS12x separation is great. Nice big wide soundstage..

>I can tell ya one thing about the KZ ZS12 pro. The cord stinks when its brand new.. I thought my phones battery was about to catch fire or something.. nope it was just my new iems wires off gassing chemicals. Eventually this passed. It no longer smells bad.

>Final impressions: KZ ZS12 pro.
>Its detailed not loud.
>Its certainly good for gaming. Separation is handy there. The soundstage is big. I'm gonna be using this for some battle royale fps gaming for sure.
>For music its just meh. I do like the big soundstage and separation. On the otherhand the mids and treble are less impactfull. . I sorta prefer my single DD sets for this.
>All in all the the KZ ZA12 pro gets a 7 out of 10 from me.

## Interconnect Impressions
*11/10/2025*

What the fuck is this.
>![](https://i.postimg.cc/K8tHpmc4/Interconnect-Impressions-1.png)
>Got a bunch of interconnects on loan courtesy of Nightjar, posting impressions for archival purposes:
>
>\>Nightjar Vanguard 4W IC:
>Nothing really changed, maybe mildly brighter (or harsher) lower-treble.
>
>\>Nightjar Blue Hour 4W IC:
>Minute changes. A little more subbassy and sparkle up top.
>
>\>Nightjar Mira 4W IC:
>Lower treble feels more well-defined and extended, treble character is similar to the actual Mira Mk2 cable.
>
>\>Nightjar Sovereign Symphony IC:
>More spacious and extended, a tad warmer, treble character is similar to the actual Sovereign Symphony. However cable length is too short due to the increased plug size, a custom length may be required.
>
>\>Nightjar x Arctand Onyx IC (prototype):
>Can’t tell the difference.
>
>\>Nightjar x Arctand Rubi-lite IC (prototype):
>Bass sounds tighter, and more clearly defined. Treble is mildly more extended.
>
>\>Nightjar x Arctand Rubi IC (prototype):
>Cleaner sounding, brighter.
>
>Verdicts:
>Vanguard and Onyx are massive duds. Mira and Sovereign are worth considering for their treble but I'm leaning towards Mira more. Rubi and Rubi-lite also changes the treble but I don't fuck with the looks.
>>this kills the eqtard
>>>kills of laughter
>>>>Pretty sure the amount of money in that pic can buy a house, a car and a wife in eqtard's country of origin and the poster decided to buy a bunch of cables and some chinkaporean iems instead.
>>>>>\>implying i need to buy a wife when teen girls already lust after my bitch breaker
>>>>>anyway recommend me another $10 IEM
>>>>
>>>>>Pretty sure the amount of money in that pic is jack shit and hes getting scammed by companies, but whatever, I dont give a shit about in ear dildos at this point
>
>>bro... just sell all that crap and buy Mysticraft HEX
>>>\>$8,999.00
>>>\>contains piezo
>>>into the trash it goes
>>
>>>I am probably getting Mysticraft Hex too, but the current waitlist is till Feb 2026, so fuck that, gonna try to cop a used set from within my circle.
>
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/jd3xqQyQ/Interconnect-Impressions-2.jpg)
>
>>These tests are worth jack shit unless you 1:1 whole chain. Storm with timestamp has the same ewank weight like all that tl;dr
>
>>More interconnect impressions:
>>\>Rolling Force Choco IC
>>Cleaner tonality and smoother treble, massively underrated. Less than a hundred bucks and matches the Arctand Rubi IC which costs approx $2000.
>>
>>\>Rolling Force Suika IC
>>Darker and muddier than the stock EA4 IC. Pass.
>>
>>\>Rolling Force Mercury IC
>>Slight lower treble sparkle, also sounds like the treble decays slower.
>>
>>\>Rolling Force Diamond IC
>>Similar effect to the Mercury, but treble has a glassy sheen to it. I like this one.
>>
>>\>Rolling Force Violet IC
>>Spacious sounding, added airiness but kills bass definition.
>>
>>\>Rolling Force Cosmo IC
>>Nothing changed.
>>>splendid. you'll be receiving a passive aggressive invitation for sex from graphfag shortly
>>
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/cLfbkd1v/Interconnect-Impressions-3.png)
>>>(me) Also heard one of the best fucking amps in the world today. Ianus Protos paired with the Weiss DAC204. Sounds like a coked up version of the Mass Kobo 475 - light on the dynamics and airy sounding with that tube sparkle but none of the added heft to the mids like cheaper sounding tubes. I had no idea tube amps can sound like that it's crazy.
>>
>>>\>paying $2000 for an impedence adapter
>>>I kneel

## Moondrop Aria 2 Impressions
*09/10/2025*

>>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/wBLRsbVY/Luxury-Precision-EA4-Custom-Case-Unboxing-4.png)
>>>>From 皮栈手工皮具 (or Kevin) on taobao - vouched by my chinese bros but lowkey doesn't feel worth it. Paid $230 but craftsmanship doesn't seem as good as Jutem. Even from the pic u can see strands sticking out because the cut wasn't clean. Also the "metal" grills is flimsy and sounds like plastic, the ones on the Jutem actually feels like metal.

## KZ ZVX Pro Impressions
*07/10/2025*

>Just got the KZ ZVX PRO and I'm blown away by how much better they are than the Tangzu Waner SG and the Zero 2 I already have.
>They sound great stock, balanced in all frequencies, there isn't that high-mid sibilance/metallic unpleasantness you find in the other 2. The bass also is so clear and with a fast decay, doesn't sound as bloated as the other two.
>They even cost like 1/2 of the Zero 2, those things are SO much better than the Zero 2, I will never trust reviewers again
>>\>standard is Zero2 and Waner1
>>rip
>>>C'mon the Zero 2 are absolutely the most suggested cheap IEMs, and the Wan'er are also up there along with the Chu 2 (which I haven't heard). Either way those KZ ZVX PRO are so much better than both at half the price
>>>>buy chu2 or rosefinch next

## Tale of /iemg/ 
*06/10/2025*

>In Willow Creek, Foxbum’s bakery, The Crusty Loaf, was known for decent muffins, but he was invisible to most. He pined for Iemg, the librarian whose warm voice lit up storytime. Foxbum dreamed of winning her over with a perfect batch.
>
>The town’s talent show offered a chance: the winner would co-host the Summer Fair with Iemg. Foxbum practiced juggling and a shaky stand-up routine, hoping to stand out.
>
>Then Simzo arrived, a slick guitarist with charm that turned heads. His stories had Iemg laughing, her eyes locked on him. Foxbum’s heart sank, his confidence crumbling.
>
>At the talent show, under harsh stage lights, Foxbum’s juggling was a disaster—balls hit the floor, earning scattered pity claps. Simzo’s soulful song and witty tale electrified the crowd. Iemg’s applause for him felt like a knife to Foxbum.
>
>The final round asked for a personal story. Simzo’s polished tale of adventure dazzled. Foxbum, voice cracking, shared a raw memory of baking with his grandma, a flicker of hope in his words. But the crowd barely stirred. Iemg’s polite nod crushed him.
>
>Simzo won, crowned Star of the Show. At the fair, Iemg and Simzo shone together, their chemistry undeniable. Foxbum watched from the sidelines, muffins untouched on his vendor table. Simzo, oblivious, slapped Foxbum’s shoulder, saying, “Nice try, man.” Iemg didn’t glance his way.
>
>As lanterns lit the night, Foxbum stood alone, his dreams of Iemg shattered. He packed up his stall, the weight of failure heavy. Yet, in the quiet, he vowed to keep baking, to find his own light, even if it burned dimmer than Simzo’s.

## Hidizs ST2 Pro Impressions
*06/10/2025*

>So as a headphone only lover who cannot stand earbuds, after seeing many of these thread, I decided to get some ST2 Pros for my phone (so usbc)...
>Lets say I am fairly pleasantly surprised. They needed EQ for sure but... desu for the price they do a pretty decent job compared to my beyer 990 and my good old trusty HD25...
>I put them thru their paces with tracks I kbow by heart and they did pretty good, a few gripes here and there but really forgivable stuff. Even noticed some tiny tiny details in the mix I had missed with my HD25.
>However long term reliability is likely to be a problem. And comfort is okay but once again i dont like earbuds so this is very close...
>Would I do a deeply analytical listen on these? No. Listen occasionally, sure.
>Something I find disturbing is that i now hear every movement of my jaw, lips, tongue, breath.
>>\>Something I find disturbing is that i now hear every movement of my jaw, lips, tongue, breath.

## Tanchjim Origin Lost Manor Review
*04-05/10/2025*

>Jim won.
>>sheetzo, post the most detailed of impressions please
>>and don't forget the comparison with the psyche, kthxbye
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZMpgbMS/Tanchjim-Origin-Lost-Manor-Review-2.png)
>>>It's just the Origin with less treble. Sounds slightly better to my ears. I removed a few dB off the Origin's treble filters. The bass also sounds slightly better but I might be deluding myself.
>>>As for the Psyche, I never really liked the stock sound of it so there's no real reason to compare.
>>>>f-fuck, at least the tuning and faceplates are worth the extra $300 compared to the origin right?
>>>>please say yes, i want to buy this shit so bad
>>>>>Tanch Luna engraved version didn't cost $300 extra over the standard. It's just FOMO tax.
>>>>
>>>>>Faceplates for sure, its up there with the Psyche in terms of design. It also comes with the biggest case I've ever seen. It should only cost like $50 more than the Origin + Cable X combo ($350) which is basically what you're getting, but the tariffs inflate that by an extra $200. The extra $50 for the faceplates and ridiculous accessory package (there's even a hardcover picture book in it) would be worth it but yeah its hard to justify at the current price in the US.
>>>>>>guess i'll stick with my origins then, what a bummer
>>>>>>i would understand if they upped the price a bit for the faceplate and other stuff, but almost double the price feels insane for a collector's item that is basically the same as the origins
>>>

## Tangzu Wan'er Impressions
*04/10/2025*

>Got the Tangzu Waner SG. First impression is that they sound kinda dull/unexciting, it's like the attack of the instruments is blunted, at least they are not as sibilant/shouty as the zero 2 are stock. I definitely need to EQ them
>
>The package is really beautiful though, you get a lot of stuff for like 14 bucks

## TRN ST7 Impressions
*01/10/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/cH3hCmK4/TRN-ST7-Impressions.jpg)
>I'm EQing my freshly burned in TRN ST7. The ear rape isn't too bad, pretty standard for IEMs actually but the 2DD needs a chance to shine. It's starting to sound more like a proper V-shape rather than treblecannons. Kind of a shame but I can see how the tuning got too zealous with trying to impress with muh treble detail and catering to chinks and their shallow neotenous ear cunnies that love to be pierced. Best $20 I ever spent. White people need to season they earphones after all.
>>This is one real reason for burnin, saves a lot of time on EQ
