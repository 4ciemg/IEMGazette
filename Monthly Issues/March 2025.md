## Guide to extracting measurements from Hangout.Audio

>>>look through archives, one anon had a method although it's a bit convoluted
>>>most efficient way is to trace it with vituix or usytrace

>>>>nothing of the sort, the measurements from crinacle have been locked down for a while after his patreon fiasco
>>>>the new hangout measurements with the 5128 are arguably more valuable

>>>>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/R0tRGt8y/Guide-to-extracting-measurements-from-Hangout-Audio-3.png)
>>>>>>Open the network tab, click on any IEM, hover over initiator, click on the highest VM100 link. Then scroll down a little and find the line
>>>>>>`if (!Ze[Pg(-0xe7, 0x3e)](Zk => Zk !== null))`
>>>>>>Click the dash to left of that string, it will become blue. Then click another IEM, it will pause at that line, hover over Ze and it will show two graphs, right click, copy string contents. To unpause press F8. If you clicked on an IEM you wanted before it will be cached, click on an IEM you don't want, reload the page without closing the dev tools, click on the IEM you want.
>>>>>>><3 ty so much anon!!
>>>>>>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/c4DXJ0w9/Guide-to-extracting-measurements-from-Hangout-Audio-4.png)
>>>>>>>>Btw the number in VM100 is random, don't get confused. In the future if he changes anything you can press the dash directly where the initiator led you to and then keep pressing F10 until you see a measurement string appear.
>>>>>>>>>Got it. Thanks again!

## CVJ Luki Measurements
*29/03/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/76MNrkqN/CVJ-Luki-Measurements-1.png)
>Definitely one of the weirdest graphing and sounding IEM I have come across (0 smoothing on squig, 1/24 in REW. Try to guess which one it is.
>Full detailed review will be coming when I manage to get good measurements.
>>wtf? what’s the name of this POS?
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/zB1kQBYB/CVJ-Luki-Measurements-2.png)
>>>prolly CVJ Konoka
>>>the nigger buzzer making a heartbeat pulse in the fr is pretty unique
>>>>I was thinking about that one. Forgot it’s name I did remember though because that bass is so motherfreaking weird
>>>>>It's the CVJ Luki, which is essentially the Konoka as you've guessed but without the switches.
>>>>>They have this weird driver in there only for the bass, you can hear and feel it vibrate whenever you touch it, it's strange. The same happens with the Thieaudio Hype series but to a much lesser degree (only when worn is it possible to hear one of the drivers vibrate)
>>>>>I don't know how to feel about this, but basic EQ seems to work nicely for now.

>I tried my autism stack with them and they fucking slap.
>I set the line out volume to 50% and the amp to high gain. That way I get more power into them without high volume (still plenty to avoid distortion)
>Perfect V shape sound but without the dogshit bloated bass or eardrum piercing sibilance on the pos that you retards shill.
>I listen to a lot of police and Copeland's cymbals often zap your ears on sibilant pos. Not here.
>You can actually EQ even more bass, the low end "extension" here is crazy for something that doesn't seal. You can also flatten them out for non-music use.
>It's just a shame my earussy is too tight, they start making my ears sore after an hour or so.

## Letshuoer DZ4 Impressions
*26/03/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/mDRQw571/Letshuoer-DZ4-Impressions.jpg)
>\>Letshuoer DZ4
>Surprising. I've had Artti R1 for a while, and DZ4 is the predecessor using similar driver config.
>Not as bass-lite as I expected, adequate low end when called upon. Mids and treble are light and ethereal, with an "echo," trailing decay effect. Female vocals have a lot of breath. This effect is quite a bit more noticeable on DZ4 compared to R1, maybe because R1 has heftier mid bass warmth versus DZ4's more transparent mid-range. Even with the unique echo-effect, I find it coherent and well tuned. Good layering and good speed.
>If you're bored of average 1DD, enjoy female poison, and want a slight vibrant / fast tilt to the sound, pretty good for the ~$30 sales price.
>>wtf were they thinking with those old cable ear hooks

## Kiwi Ears x HBB Punch Impressions
*23/03/2025*

![](https://i.postimg.cc/m2qCqDQs/Kiwi-Ears-x-HBB-Punch-Impressions-1.jpg)
>\>Kiwi Ears x HBB Punch
>Don't care to give it shine, but reporting for anyone interested. My units are channel matched well. Takes more power than average to drive. Fairly chonky. Don't have them on hand but it skews more towards Thieaudio Origin shell size and shape rather than Hype 4. Fits bulkier and less flush than Mega5EST, ultimately not bothersome or an issue for me.
>Sounds best with wide bore tip and deep insertion, which the shell and stock tips are not conducive to. Bass is solid, mids have slight metallic timbre, highs are good (for me) because they are not overly emphasized in an attempt to overcome the bass. Understand what Punch delivers, dominant bass. Need to push higher volume if you want mids and treble to pop into place, which entails strong bass.
>>got measurements? also post pic of it sideways, shit looks massive from promo photos

>>for me the punch is a failure of a set. yes the bass is dominant, but its also incredibly pillowy - practically bleeds into the mids.
>>>Yeah if I remember you're one of the few who has heard it and were harsh. To me, it's fine quality overall. As I mention, you want wide bore tip and real deep insertion, and I get that it sounds "simple," but I'm being genuine, the volume needs to be pushed if you want the mids to pop out more and feel less drowned out. The stock tips absolutely give a more occluded sound. iirc they're also affected by source output impedance, only making it muddier.

## Hangout Squatter Impressions
*07-22/03/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/bwJV0sqf/Hangout-Squatter-Impressions-1.png)
>Quick impressions blogpost today:
>
>\>Letshuoer Mystic 8
>Decent resolution. Focus is on female vocals. But bass and lower-mids need serious work. Male vocals is very anemic. And lower-register instruments lack authority. Certainly not my first choice for a vocal set.
>
>Also the stock cable for the M8 reminds me of the flimsy zero:red cable. Appalling. 6/10.
>
>\>Hercules Audio Moses
>Bassy V tuning. Insider gossip says the Moses is a re-shelled Elysian Anni/Elysian X. I’d believe it. The Moses sounds like the Annihilator but it gives up the Anni’s treble extension for a stronger subbass emphasis.
>
>There's plenty of bassy V-shape summit-fi pos (A&K Novus, VE10, Macbeth etc), so I don’t see the point of Moses. But it is good sound. 8/10.

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/5tpth7ZC/Hangout-Squatter-Impressions-2.png)
>Mass pos impressions fotmslop edition
>
>\>Symphonium Giant
>New warmfi pos from Symphonium. Treble extends really far like the Storm but bass lacks definition. Midbass and lowermids are tuned in a way which risks drowning out female vocals. It’s not a cohesive tuning but I liked it for male vocals. And ironically the older Symphonium Meteor ends up being the more relaxing listen despite the Giant being designated the “warm” set. 6/10.
>
>\>CrinEar Meta
>Bona fide JM-1 timbre like Mega5EST. Slightly better treble extension than M5E, with no hint of sibilance. But subbass lacks physicality, and midbass fails to give instruments that authority (this is quite evident on the 5128). Male and female vocals are good though.
>
>Safe blind-buy, but nothing impressive – it’s just a cheaper M5E. 7/10.
>
>\>CrinEar Daybreak
>JM-1 adjacent tuning but with more coloration. Compared to Meta, Daybreak has a stronger subbass response, and more pinna gain. Can get shouty like Harman, so it’s not a safe blind-buy. Even if Crin didn’t intend to do so, this is a good female vocals set.
>
>For those who find the M5E boring/muddy and prefer slight Harman coloration. 7.5/10.
>
>\>Truthear X Crinacle Zero Blue 2
Improvement over the OG Blue in terms of resolution. Still very bright, with peaky treble. Strictly a mid to low volume set. Mids are too lean and instrumental timbre is off.
>
>Impedance adapter improves Blue 2 significantly. Now it starts sounding like a proper V-shape set. Nice rumble and bass boost helps to tame the peaky treble a lot. Some semblance of warmth too.
>
>4/10 without impedance, 8/10 with impedance.
>
>\>Binary Acoustics Dynaquattro
>Bassy warm with peaky treble. Very tip dependent. Using generic medium-bore tips (nicehck07) causes muddy bass and sibilance. The issue is remedied somewhat with deep insertion tips like aex70 or wide bores. After that you get a decent warmfi set with good male vocals.
>
>Risky blind-buy and not worth the hassle of babying it. 4/10.
>>hm, shame about the dynaquattro. still a pos i wanna give a listen to some day
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/2SR3hBQV/Hangout-Squatter-Impressions-3.png)
>>>if you're into tip-rolling it isn't the worst set you could buy. tho i would pick the sliivo anyday


>![](https://i.postimg.cc/HnFnSrFv/Hangout-Squatter-Impressions-4.png)
>Mass pos impressions bnuuy edition
>
>\>Binary x Gizaudio Chopin & Truthear Nova
>Chopin sounded better than I remembered. Nova has a stronger subbass but Chopin has marginally more warmth in its lower-mids. Chopin also has a tad more treble extension.
>
>IMO Chopin >= Nova = Supermix 4. Whether it’s worth the collab tax is another matter. But all three Harman pos are still decent in 2025. 7/10 for all of em.
>
>\>Tanchjim Bunny DSP (stock)
>Bright neutral with plenty of treble zing. Thin-sounding though not as lean as the Blue 2. Too harsh sounding for my liking – that 12k peak on the 5128 is very real – I’d choose the Salnotes Zero/Truthear Gate over the bnuuy any day. 4/10.
>
>\>Moondrop x HSR Robin
>Warm, relaxing listen. Good heft in the midbass and lower-mids. Sounds like a smoother Zero:Red. May sound dark for some – treble could definitely use a tad more extension, but it’s perfectly viable for casual listening. Tuned surprisingly well. 9/10.
>
>PSA: Apparently the Robin TWS has atrocious Bluetooth connectivity. The owner of this unit mentioned that even the simple act of walking will cause the audio to cut off. If you intend to buy this prepare to get moondropped.
>>omg xixtas... i thought bunny was endgame... yall lied to me
>>>Not bunny. Fox.
>
>>I thought you were that other review anon that gave gate a 2/10 said it was shite.
>>ya idk what his deal was my pair did not have any weird resonance or timbre issues. Bright and harmanish sure but not wonky.
>>>Sorry anon that was me too. My issue wasn't with the tuning of the Gate, but rather the cheap plastic housing which creates a chamber echo. It's present to an extent on all chinkslop 1DD pos but was especially bad with my unit of the Gate.
>>>>interesting maybe my ears are broke I did not hear any ringing or unusual resonance.


>![](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nq4PS0B/Hangout-Squatter-Impressions-5.png)
>Mass poss impressions:
>
>\>Flipears Aegis and Flipears Legion
>They sound similar so I’m grouping them together. Both have a warm V-shape signature which is balanced with slightly boosted treble. Similar tuning as the Symphonium Giant.
>Legion sounds marginally brighter than Aegis.
>
>Both have issues – Aegis has a metallic-sounding treble while Legion has questionable BCD implementation which causes bass to sound bloomy and slow. Questionable tunings but not unlistenable. 5/10 for both.
>
>\>Oriolus Traillii (JP)
>Clean and bright, with extended treble. Like an Annihilator’23 without the boosted bass.
>Traillii is called a vocal set but it’s not as shouty as typical Harman sets like Chopin or Nova.
>
>The airiness of the treble causes the Traillii to not sound as warm as the squigs. There’s some mid-bass and lower-mids presence but it doesn’t sound warm nor bassy.
>
>Proper execution of a highly detailed set. Like a Cadenza 4 that doesn’t sound as thin. 10/10.
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/rpG4KN7V/Hangout-Squatter-Impressions-6.png)
>>\>Traillii is 10/10

## Truthear Gate & Red Comparison
*21-22/03/2025*

>Anon who posted about zero red got me curious about an actual comparison between them and deep insertion gateymotics. I have both right next to me so screw it.
>…Used this song because there’s tons of crap going on and lots of layers between frequencies(I-i s-swear Im not a weeb senpai)
>https://youtu.be/Atvsg_zogxo?si=YG96OfSVHFidDw-R
\>zero red
>typical very well balanced IEM sound off the bat. The vocals and instruments sound a bit more distant. In isolation I can’t really tell but vs gateymotics or most headPOS I can detect there is definitely a lower mids tuck because the heft and weight is not as much. Doesn’t sound bad at all. The treble sounds well tuned but there’s some small peaks and dips in there, >probably around the resonance peak around 7khz.
>\>gateymotics
>That. Stupid. Bass.
>Immediately I can tell not only are the lower mids filled but there’s an even bigger glide into the bass. Visceral, guttural bass. But still not overblown.
>Mids are definitely more forward and in your face but I wouldn’t say “shouty” just closer. Tonality is actually lovely and the singer is present but not overblown in any way. The treble is dead. freaking. smooth. the layers just come together.
>
>\>tonality
>gateymotics win. They’re just completely effortless can listen to them all day long. Not to say the zero reds are bad but that downward tilt is lovely
>\>soundstage
>probably zero reds due to tuning and shallow insertion. Things are naturally more distant
>\>imaging
>gateymotics. Pinpoint accuracy
>
>Finally as for details and separation? This is a tough one.
>I think on the surface that stinky motherflipping BASS of gateymotics may mask some minor details but then I still feel like I hear everything gently and effortlessly dancing in the background. Zero reds tuning gives it an advantage here but I feel like it has less zing and pop which gives it less imaging and separation. I’m calling this one a tie.
>
>This was a somewhat close batter but deep insertion gate wins
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/zD2gbB2g/Truthear-Gate-Red-Comparison-1.jpg)
>>\>Mids are definitely more forward and in your face but I wouldn’t say “shouty” just closer.
>>Hey flangebro, after that one anon recently tried gate + triple flange tips and found its upper mids too forward, I played around with eq and tone generator with my gateymotics, and set 4.4 kHz, 2.2 Q, -2 to -4 dB. That kind of fixes the issue with the upper mids. You might want to try that, would be interesting to hear your impressions.
>>
>>Also, don't get discouraged by these people here, see picrel.
>>>I’ll definitely try to experiment with EQ when I get the chance.
>>>I think the “closer” sound is due to the tuning with upper mids yes but also because the sound physically closer to the ear too.
>>>The fullness of the lower mids makes it not sound shouty but i am curious what EQ will do this thing is basically flat so an amazing platform for wideband
>>>I don’t have access to EQ right now but I assume if I lower the upper mids it might make the bass a bit TOO smelly and dark. So I’d probably have to tone that back down a tad. If this was shallow insertion tips you’re 100% right take a decent chunk out of that 2-5khz range and everything else should line up(sans resonances and upper treble)
>>>>\>if I lower the upper mids it might make the bass a bit TOO smelly and dark
>>>>Exactly how I perceive it, this is why I use a lowshelf filter to fix the bass, in addition to the upper-mid-cut:

>>>>To me, this is a neutral sound, aka my preference. The stock tuning is, to me, a bass- and upper-mid-boosted sound. There is nothing wrong with it, it's just not my preference.
>>
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/SRRY1FRR/Truthear-Gate-Red-Comparison-2.png)
>>>Previous anon here, I was using the wrong size tip. The mediums are wider bore and only differ from the smalls in bore diameter and stem length. The issues I brought up before are not as present with the medium tips but I still prefer the stock sound. The EQ filter does help a lot but its still just missing that bit of treble spice. Anyways, here's some graphs for you guys, I support your struggle.
>>>>What is going on here and where are these measurements from? This is very nice to have. These measurements seem to confirm the increased bass and mids compared to stock tips that anon described in his hand-drawn graphs. Also, it confirms what I heard in the tone-generator: A peak around 4 kHz. What is the EQ used here for the bright line? This looks like -4 dB at 4.1 kHz, pretty close to what I use.
>>>>Everything above 5 kHz confuses me, but below 5 kHz it's pretty much how we flangezos said it sounds like.
>>>
>>>>really interesting graphs…does anyone have that other anon’s graphs that showed gate with different insertion depths? it basically showed the treble being smoother and smoother the deeper the fit went.
>>>>I’ll have to go back and try to see if I determine that 4khz on a sine wave sweep or something if it’s really bumped up that much it should be easy to tell and perceptually should be like 7db louder than 3khz.
>>>>As for the bass some other anon said it changes but I doubt a 711 coupler can perceive the changes. 711s always overestimate bass because of the cavity size being much larger than a human ear. I think Resolve explained it pretty well.
>>>>I am interested to see if bass changes on a 5128 though I want to see crin or someone straight graph an ety POS like er2se, we might be surprised by how much low end it actually has when compared to a 711

## Mass Tips Impressions
*20/03/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/tgbZQVJL/Mass-Tips-Impressions-1.png)
>No iem impressions today, just tip impressions:
>
>\>Azla Crystal 2
>The Crystal 2 is like a warmer variant of the OG.
>
>Compared to the OG Crystals, the Crystal 2 is marginally less airy, probably due to the addition of the waxguard. There is less treble extension as a result. Additionally the midbass/lowermids of the Crystal 2 sounds a tad more forward than the OG.
>
>\>Final Audio Fusion-G
>Don't get baited into thinking these are silicone tips like the Type E - these tips are actually foam hybrids, and the packaging says to replace them every 3 months (what a scam).
>
>The Fusion-G sounds like a generic medium-bore tip. But compared to the Nicehck07, the fusion-g is more midbass focused, and it also tames the uppermids and treble. Female vocals can sound slightly recessed as a result.
>
>The fusion-g are also short stumpy tips so the fit was weird. Don't expect a perfect fit just cuz you bought your usual sizing.
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/hG0JSP7h/Mass-Tips-Impressions-2.png)
>>Pics for reference, tips from left to right:
>>Type E (L), Fusion-G (L), Crystal 1 (M), Crystal 2 (M)
>>>ty.
>>>can you explain to me the diff between Crystal and XELASTEC? I've been told to get XELASTEC 2 because it's the comfiest set of tips available.
>>>>not him but
>>>>Crystal are LSR (liquid silicone rubber), they are more akin to regular tips you encounter that hold their shape.
>>>>Xelastics are TPE (thermoplastic elastomer), their advertised property is that they change shape when heated (deform to your ear canal shape).
>>>>\>comfiest set of tips available
>>>>you cannot listen to anyone who ever makes such a statement. (You) are the person who determines if they are comfy or not. it's completely realistic for someone to be totally on the opposite end and find them uncomfortable, finicky, and not ideal because they deform
>>>>>Thanks anon. But I have heard about Xelastec being comfy from numerous people over the past year. I just haven't pulled the plug on them.
>>>>>>sure try em out if you want. i barely use xelastics
>>>>>>>\>sure try em out if you want. i barely use xelastics
>>>>>>>What do you use/recommend?
>>>>>>>I have narrow ear canals... I have trouble finding comfy tips.
>>>>>>>>part of the point i'm trying to get across to you is it doesn't even matter what i use. I am me, you are you. some people are weirdos and exclusively use foams. i hate foams and never use them. some people can claim they love xelastics. i think they're only a good pairing a small portion of the time.

## KZ ED9 Pro Impressions
*19-20/03/2025*

>I'm glad I got the KZ ED9 Pro instead of the Ling long.
>
>As long as you don't mind it being clunky for a bullet IEM and like the bass/neutral nozzle gimmick. The cable looks a lot more durable than the old one.
>>ye see you in a few months when they implode into static mess. you bought very old models of earphones with little to no quality assurance
>>>We'll see. I think they lied about it having a larger 8mm driver but it still sounds really good.
>>>I like the heavy metallic feeling of these, they have really good separation and detail.
>>>
>>>The only one I haven't tried was the Princess Chang Le, I might try that if these break.

## Symbio W Tips Impressions
*19/03/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/VLSbj82H/Symbio-W-Tips-Impressions.jpg)
>I got the Symbio W hybrid tips after some anon mentioned them last thread.
>They do exactly what I wanted
>\>keep IEMs in place that usually tend to slip out and lose seal while moving around
>\>don't change the sound much if at all
>\>fit on wide bore IEM stems just fine
>No comfort issues either. Dunno why people would use regular foam tips when those exist unless they're specifically looking to change the sound.
Would recommend.
>>\>Dunno why people would use regular foam tips
>>Because many of them use them as copium to reduce treble resonance peaks. You do not get that effect from hybrid pairs like that, which have silicone lining the inner bore and outer umbrella. Also, foam naturally diffuses some air & sound pressure. When there is a silicone barrier, they no longer fulfill that function.

## Shanling MG20 & MG100 Impressions
*14/03/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/T2sK2shj/Shanling-MG20-MG100-Impressions-1.jpg)
>free chinkshit anon back again
>
>today, it's SHANLING time
>
>50 dollar mg20s, and 160 dollar mg100s. they both appear to be single dd iems, with some different materials, accessories and in the case of the more expensive pair, swappable filters that change the tuning? what are the chances the fucking 50 dollar pair sounds better?
>>pre 2018 female poison pos, lowkey based
>
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/c48rvc8p/Shanling-MG20-MG100-Impressions-2.jpg)
>>mg20 is pretty bare for presentation, but accessories include a pouch and an ass load of tips, very nice. all metal construction as far as i can tell as well. cable is fairly cheap but does the job better than kz pos. sound is very neutral as far as i can tell, bit of a bass boost but not too crazy, highs are not sharp whatsoever compared to some other cheap offerings. mid sounds a bit hollow however. not sure why. overall, first impression 6/10
>
>>MG20s IIRC looked decent on the manufacturer graph and then actually measured and sounded like dogshit when people got them.
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/fyVkjcq0/Shanling-MG20-MG100-Impressions-3.jpg)
>>>i think they sound aiight, but it's kind of silly when kz pos can measure and resolve better at 20 bucks than these can at 50. it is what it is however.
>>>
>>>up next we got the mg100. as you can see they're a lot more generous in presentation and accessories. microfiber cloth, leather carry case, two tips that interchange on the much nicer cable. a crap load of tips that seem to be labeled for further tuning, vocal, bass, balanced, and a single pair of memory foam tips. all metal construction for these as well, but the cable itself is mmcx rather than 2 pin. weird change but i don't mind it. there are also interchangeable nozzles, the stainless steel is the more relaxed, bass boosted filter, and the brass in the pic apparently tune the bass down a bit and release the highs more. sticking with the stainless steel nozzle for now as that was preinstalled.
>>>
>>>upon first listen on the balanced tips, these have less bass than the mg20 right away. highs are a tad sharper, but ears get used to it after a while. the sound is definitely more treble focused than the mg20 out of the box with the balanced tips.. lemme switch to the bass tips...
>>>
>>>..aaand holy fuck there we fuckin go. that's a FUCK lot more bass. these tips actually fucking do something which is saying a lot since most tips labeled for different things in my experience barely change anything at all. these fuckers thump and balance out the sharp high now. not bad at all! might keep to these for a little bit. once the bass is balanced these become a lot more fun to listen to.
>>>
>>>first listen was a 4/10, bass tips make them a 7.5/10
>>>
>>>both sets are fuckin tiny too compared to a lot of other standard resin shell iems. very lightweight.
>>>
>>>songs played for each listen:

## AFUL MagicOne Review
*12/03/2025*

Thank you for reposting this.

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/CKw16T60/AFUL-Magic-One-Review-1.jpg)
>Just found my old MagicOne review, so I'll repost it here for the Gazette.
>
>It came in. Measurements and impressions coming soon.
>
>Cable doesn't really match but it's fine for now.
>
>Not much to say when it comes to first impressions.
>Sound quality is actually normal. Bass is there, although subbass isn't really prominent; the bass that is present is actually very good. Mids also sound decent for the most part. There's immediately a noticeable treble peak somewhere that is making everything very sharp and borderline sibilant no matter what instrument.
>Comfort is good, the fit is snug and isolation is also great. I'll probably compare with the Tiandirenhe that I covered a while back, because both share the same shape and fit (at least 95% the same).
>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/g2VjDks4/AFUL-Magic-One-Review-2.png)
>>I don't even know where to start with the measurements, but here I go...
>>First is the channel matching, which is pretty good here. I don't really notice the small deviations seen above 5khz. It certainly isn't bothersome.
>>
>>Next is the insertion depth measurements. If there's something you should remember from this review, it's this particular graph.
>>It is immediately obvious that the resonance that will occur in your ear will vary depending on insertion depth, which is a fact most seem to know.
>>However, the resonance here has a very large bandwidth compared to most other sets, especially when comparing the shallowest and deepest measurements. The resonance is absolutely massive both in range and amplitude, and indicates very low to no damping. Reminder that measurements were done on "normal" bore silicone tips of varying lengths/sizes.
>>What is also interesting to note is the sharp decrease near 18-19khz, mainly with the deepest (red) curve where a second resonance is not present.
>>
>>Finally, here is the full distortion profile of the MagicOne at 86, 94, and 104db (going down, with +/-5db).
>>As expected, 3rd HD is very present, at least for relatively low volume testing. What is interesting here is the "dominance" of 2nd HD at higher and higher volume.
>>I have to repeat this again and again; for my listening volume, distortion will never be an issue. The same story applies here, especially when considering the isolation that this provides. While the measurement at 86db isn't great by any standard, it is still way below the threshold of audibility (probably).
>>>So final thoughts, I think it looks very cool, the fit is good, the isolation is excellent, and the sound is actually decent stock.
>>>However, when compared to my Tiandirenhe which offers the same type of build quality and isolation, the differences between the both of them is very small after EQ. If only fit and isolation is important, I say get the Tiandirenhe, which is very cheap and has less pressure build up.

## EPZ P50 Review
*07/03/2025*

Thanks for linking everything together, appreciate it! 
And no, I'm not dead.

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/gcV7mCgQ/EPZ-P50-Review-1.jpg)
>EPZ P50
>\>Shell Design
>Medium size pseudocustom shape with good ergonomics. Easy fit to get stable seal. Medium insertion depth.
>Lipless nozzle. I did encounter used Spring Tips (oily and wider bore) falling off when removing the IEMs. For tips with tighter friction grip like the stock tips, it should be a non-issue. 5.5mm nozzle diameter is good.
>\>Cable
>\>Pros
>Low profile 3.5/4.4 swappable termination with threaded screw lock, quality conductors, lightweight.
>\>Cons
>\Too stiff, springy, and retains memory. A hassle to manage. Pin design meant for recessed slot for a flush 2-pin IEM. Low profile plug can be awkward to grip when plugging in/out.
>>Other Accessories
>2x identical SML sets of black core 07 tips. Nice puck case.
>>\>Sound
>>I listened with stock cable 4.4 and M stock tips, but later settled on Juzear Limpid 4.4 and M BGVP W01 tips.
>>Moderate sensitivity.
>>Deep sub bass has presence, but not intense or domineering. Mid bass through lower mids is full bodied with engaging kick. This fullness can sound a bit thick or bloomed at times.
>>Upper mids are prominent. Older mastering such as classical or American pop / rock have good instrument articulation and even-keeled male and female vocals. Modern production with female vocals sounds forward, and louder volume increases how close vocals feel. Rides a line for female poison. Mids timbre is good but not stellar.
>>Upper treble has distinct granular shimmer and tizzy-ness of micro planars. It may be novelty, but I think they have an interesting sound compared to BAs. Reigned in amplitude, treble details are not forcibly pushed, but there is good agility and extension into ultra high frequencies. Better tweeters than low quality BAs, but short of top-tier authentic timbre when critically listening to percussion instruments.
>>Full frequency layering and macro details are strong, while imaging, separation, and micro details are adequate. Good perception of depth, but nothing extraordinary about height or width. The drivers are well-matched, slightly fast without undue decay.
>>Overall, P50 is a solid entrant in the meta pos race, with a slightly bright and vivid tilt. At low-mid volume P50 does well to sound musical and correct, never lacking or flat. A balanced, genre fluid sound signature. At higher volume, some female vocals can step out as overly frontal.
>>>no measurements?
>>
>>>I didn't get around to graphing it yet or AB comparisons. I can if anyone specifically wants. Suffice to say my impressions were settled on in the first few days and have not waned.
>>>Some other sets which may graph similar like Kiwi Ears Quintet or Truthear Hexa, I never liked for numerous reasons, and P50 is more pleasant to listen to across the spectrum for me. If I had to place it among current market, it does well as a cheaper Mangird Tea Pro, though the Tea Pro has more powerful overall bass presence. Both present a balance of fuller lower mids with vivid clarity of upper mids through mid treble, and admirable technicalities for their price points.
>>>>just wanted to see the unit variation and channel matching mostly
>>>>also curious about the fit, and i know its semi custom, but how much of it protrudes out?
>>>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/QCJYm7Bh/EPZ-P50-Review-2.png)
>>>>>Very good channel matching as expected, I heard nothing amiss.
>>>>
>>>>>Regarding fit, it's always tricky to say because there is a whole spectrum of shell shapes, but it is medium size, and fairly opinionated. I would not call it flush or slim fitting. >>>>>It has a top wing and a bit of an aggressive bump to seat the resin body behind the antitragus, and the faceplate protrudes a few mm past my antitragus.

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/J4KdBbVQ/Shure-SE215-Knockoff-Impressions.jpg)
>Quick thoughts on Shure SE215 knockoffs.
>Meme IEM with meme cable. Nothing much to say here, comfortable and very isolating but very bad sound. Distortion is very good as expected from a 1DD.
>>Post EQ, it is quite enjoyable, the lack of treble isn't all that noticeable.
>
>>how much? fake ie900 looks more promising for an EQ template and as good comfort
>>>I got these these for $4 (IEMs + pair of tips, cable is separate), I was thinking of getting the fake IE900 as well, but there are already graphs and I know that the Shure stuff fits me a bit better.

>>No seriously, how does it sound, big difference over cheaper totls?
>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/9MGLX9YZ/Subtonic-Storm-Unboxing-7.png)
>>>\>How does it sound?
>>>Storm's sound sig is reference neutral and it sounds like a pair of studio monitors. As a frame of reference the Hexa probably has a similar-ish tonality (this is not me recommending the Hexa I think it's pos).
>>>
>>>\>big difference over cheaper totls?
>>>It's personal tuning preferences, I'm not delusional enough to claim that 6k TOTLs are better than 2~3k TOTLs. The January gazette has my A/B impressions of the Storm and Annihilator'23, and for the most part they trade blows but ultimately I preferred the Storm because it suited my library more.
>>>
>>>Case in point, Canpur CP622B and Storm - the Canpur is half the price of the Storm but both iems graph identical and sound similar in practice. Any difference is minor and boils down to subjective preference, but at this price point people don't care about diminishing returns and just want the iem that aligns best with their personal target. Canpur just happened to sound a tad warmer than the "neutral" I'm looking for so I got the Storm instead.
>>>
>>>\>Worth spending 20x over Odyssey ;^)?
>>>Odyssey's tonality is more similar to the Hype 4s. Any review that claims "new meta" or "mini-storm" is compromised.
