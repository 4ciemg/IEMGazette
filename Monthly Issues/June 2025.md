## June Mass Impressions
*28-13/06/2025*

You know the drill.
>![](https://i.postimg.cc/Df8gTCWk/June-Mass-Impressions-1.png)
>Random bullshit impressions and ramblings:  
>  
>\>Eminent Ears Emerald  
>This is the retail version of the Emerald. Warm V. Midbass and lower-mids are overwhelming. There's appropriate pinna gain and treble to balance the low-end, but it's an off-putting contrast: slow boomy bass clashing with frankly decent female vocals and treble.  
> 
>Tip-rolling helps to remedy the low-end greatly, but bass is still not its strong suit. Sounds like a slightly better zero-red.  
>  
>Stock tips - 3/10  
>Tip-rolling - 7.5/10  
>  
>\>Artpical Slime tips (eartips on the Michael)  
>Silicone material feels cheap and flimsy. Functions like a widebore. I'd choose the Divinus Prisms instead.  
>  
>\>Oriolus stock tips  
>Wide bore that for some reason kills treble extension. Also you lose a lot of subbass. Pointless.  
>  
>\>Lepic Nuon Boost and Clear  
>Tips that make your pos sound more V-shaped. Boosts bass and treble air at the expense of mids. Will not fit on IEMs with large nozzles.Not entirely pointless but super niche.  
> 
>\>iBasso DC Elite  
>Sounds like my DX340.  
> 
>\>Cayin RU9  
>Solid State and Modern Tube mode sounds similar and any differences is negligible.  
>  
>Classic Tube mode makes for a very V-shape coloration - boosted midbass and more pinna which pulls female vocals closer. It's okay but I feel the iBasso AMP16 card does this tube coloration better. The RU9 introduces these higher order harmonics in an unnatural way. Meanwhile the Cayin C9 II and Luxury & Precision EA4 makes it sound effortless.
>
>Then more.

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/NjhDtktb/June-Mass-Impressions-2.png)
>Still no Xenns Top Pro or Monarch MK4 demo. Impressions are long this time so split into two parts:  
>  
>\>Moondrop Illustrious  
>Tested on Azla Crystals - Mid centric, there’s good body to the lower-mids but female vocals still sound mildly shouty. Also slight harshness in the “SH” and “S” of female vocals yet treble extension sounds cut off. Like the Twilight, mid-bass is tight and controlled without bleeding into the mids. But the lack of treble extension hurts resolution, and makes the Illustrious less "technical” than cheaper 1DD sets.  
>  
>Tip-rolling to EBT EarrBond - using deeper insertion tips helped to remedy the harshness in female vocals. But the lack of treble air/sparkle still remained.  
>  
>I’m a fan of this “flat” tuning style but Moondrop’s execution leaves more to be desired. I'd pick the Softears Twilight and Kinera ThorKing over this. 6/10.  
>  
>\>Moondrop Harmon  
>Tested on Azla Crystals - Very tizzly treble. Decent subbass unlike the illustrious but mids are really lean which paired with the boosted pinna, makes for an unpleasant contrast.  
>  
>Despite being a harman set, female vocals don’t particularly sound good due to the edgy treble masking finer details in the vocals. Using narrow bore tips helped to add body back to the mids but now the treble sounds even more splashy.  
>  
>I'd pick the Chopin, Supermix4 or Nova over this. Stock Harman sets are already "solved" and Moondrop is trying to reinvent the wheel here. 4/10.  
>  
>\>Hisenior Cano Cristales  
> metal tube measurements aren't on par with human ears, though.Tested on Nicehck07s - Nice, smooth treble. Immediate improvement over the Moondrop Harmon. Super-bassy V-shape without being muddy. Boomy, thunderous bass like the Nightjar Duality, and nice, sparkly female vocals. Male vocals are acceptable.  
>   
>Better midrange tonality than the Moondrop Harmon. Now bearing in mind the Cristales is a very colored set, the squig doesn’t show how intense the bass really is. It’s like the Hype 4/Tea Pro on steroids.  
>  
>I would buy this. Default bass-head rec. 9.5/10.
>>Part 2:  
>>  
>>\>Kiwi Ears Etude  
>>Feels kinda cheap, there’s a hollow ringing sound when I tap on the shell.  
>>  
>>Tested on the gray stock tips – Mild V-shape, way less bassy than the Cano Cristales. I see it marketed as a basshead set, but the Etude’s sub/midbass are middling at best. The rest of the midrange is inoffensive and female vocals is appropriately positioned within the music without sounding shouty or veiled.  
>>  
>>Vibration module: Doesn’t really seem that noticeable. I can feel it vibrating when resting the pos on my palm, but it doesn’t translate much into my auditory experience. Kinda gimmicky and track-dependent.  
>>But sounds decent. No glaring flaws - treble is mildly splashy and cymbals could use more air and shimmer but I’m nitpicking. 7/10.  
>>  
>>\>Fatfreq Scarlet Mini  
>>Tested on Nicehck07s - Good subbass. But very audible bass bleed into the mids. Bass decay lingers longer than the Cano Cristales. Male vocals sound overly husky. Female vocals are decent but treble is tizzy (like the Harmon).  
>>  
>>I've heard cleaner bass. The Scarlet Mini has tons of bass quantity but at the expense of the rest of the FR. Also the Deuce is cheaper. And at its own price tier the HBB Punch & Cristales are better. The Scarlet Mini wins in sheer bass quantity but at what cost. 4/10.  
>>  
>>\>Tanchjim Origin  
>>Tested on Nicehck07s – Nice vocal centric set. Kinda enjoyable mid-bass. But incredibly tizzy/splashy treble without proper decay. Cymbal snares sound glassy. The treble timbre is distracting and fucks with the overall tonality of the set. For example, in Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga, there’s a 4-beat drum loop at around the 1-minute mark: the tizzy treble on the Origin (and slow bass) causes the 4-beat to sound only like 2 hits. Swapping to EBT EarrBonds for deeper insertion doesn’t resolve this issue.  
>>  
>>If I wanted a mid-centric vocal set I’d pick the Waner 2 – I think the $20 set unironically sounds more resolving. 3/10.
>>\>7th Acoustics Supernova  
>>Tested on SpinFit CP145 - Balanced sound with a slight treble emphasis. Bass is present but not overpowering, providing a solid foundation. Mids are clear and detailed, with natural vocal reproduction.  
>>  
>>Treble is crisp and extended, adding sparkle but can be slightly sibilant. Foam tips help tame the treble a bit, but it retains its energetic character. Build quality is excellent, with a comfortable fit and high-quality cable.  
>>  
>>Can be fatiguing over long sessions due to forward treble. Good for those seeking detail and clarity, but treble-sensitive listeners beware. 8/10.

## Gazette & EQ Guide Hosting
*27/06/2025*

The author of the EQ guide clarifies the situation.
>For clarification on the EQ guide and its hosting situation, it is under the control of I and the Editor who is in charge of the Gazette. We have discussed in length about each person's role and permissions, and we both have access to the Github account. All changes made to the EQ guide have been reviewed by myself.  
>
>The final section of the EQ guide (Myths & Misconceptions) has been completed. While it is not the most in-depth, it should suffice for now; if necessary, I plan on adding more demonstrations and details. Both the Additional Tools and Measurement Databases pages have also been updated.  
>  
>The guide is always getting small updates and refinement as new preference targets are created, and new methods become available for easier EQ. Other case studies with IEMs in various contexts will also be added.  
>  
>This project has been started since late 2023, and after 2 years of on and off work, it now contains most of what I wanted to include. There is a high probability that this is going to be the last announcement/update post I will officially do; I am often in this thread, but I haven not, and will not post much.  
> 
>Other projects are in the works.

## Random Impressions
*22/06/2025*

>so in the past like 2 weeks I've tried a few IEM's for both gaming and watching media cause I couldnt rely solely on youtube reviews alone.  
>\>Hexa  
>liked the fit and feel but the audio felt off to me for both gaming and videos  
>\>Tanchjim bunny  
>the all arounder, backup IEMs in case something breaks or i need something while waiting for another pair. worth every penny  
>\>moondrop chu 2  
>fits snug enough, audio is a bit better than the bunnys  
>\>Zero Reds  
>very good but didnt fit well in my ears to warrant keeping  
>\>Wan'er1&2  
>the Wan'er1 felt a bit off with vocals compared to the 2, I think if I were to settle on a midrange IEM at the moment it would be the Wan'er 2 as it fit well and sounded excellent overall but I wish it came in jade green  
>atm still waiting to recieve a pair of 7hz saltones zero's and a pair of Truthear gates.

## Moondrop Block Impressions
*19/06/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/25rxbjVZ/Moondrop-Block-Impressions.jpg)
>Moondrop block came in, I've been playing around with them for a couple of days so here's a quick review for whoever might be interested.  
>
>They're $20 and I like them quite a bit, they're my first tws Bluetooth earbuds or whatever people call them now so I can't really compare with other models.  
>They sound nice for buds you'd wear when fucking around in the garden, wrenching on your car, cooking or whatever. They get shat on by my more expensive gear that's more focused on critical listening but the blocks really aren't made for this kind of thing. Somehow they do have some bass, it really doesn't go that low but it's there, vocals and most instruments come out nice but they lack a bit in the high highs, then again they're just little speakers that hang in your ears so I'm pleasantly surprised.  
>Fit is a bit weird, maybe I'm just not used to non-iems, you need to get the angle just right or sound quality suffers, it's easy enough to do but you can't just shove them in your ears. They feel a bit unstable in your ears but I couldn't get them to fall off no matter what I did.  
>Touch controls are ok, they work. Latency is pretty low and good enough for videos and movies, I haven't tried gaming with them.  
>I'm torn on the case, it's super small and looks good, it not having a lid is a non-issue for me, but it's made of the shittiest, softest plastic known to man. They haven't left my desk and the case already got some phat scratches, I'm convinced you could scratch it simply by glaring at it hard enough.  
>All in all I love them, I'll still try the Huawei freebuds se 2 or 3 in the near future just to see what they're like since they seem to be the only other decent budget option for non-iem tws earbuds.

## CVJ Neko Review
*15/06/2025*

Wow.
>![](https://i.postimg.cc/XJXddr3p/CVJ-Neko-Review-1.jpg)
>She's here!
>>please tell me the print quality is horrible, that'd be so funny
>>>![](

>>>I can't deny that she looks a little... lumpy.

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/XX6CRx5C/CVJ-Neko-Review-3.png)
>Her FR is also tragic lol. I think it probably just needs more nozzle filters. EQ also does a good job as its still a single DD.

## Anon's ranking of Tanchjim products 
*1306/2025*

Anon asks for a QRD of all Tanchjim products, another anon answers
>![]()
>Ok here goes nothing. No distinction will be made between alternate versions of the same IEM, but I will mention and discuss them. No EQ (unless DSP is included), all inclusive (price, build, fit, etc). Starting from best to worst. Stuff I haven't personally tried will be marked with a \*.  
> 
>IEMs  
>\>Bunny  
>Cheap and comfortable. Stock and DSP sound good; the provided 5 filters are more than enough to polish the IEM to a very high standard.  
>\>One  
>Bunny but in bullet form. Docking points because the stock analog sound is mediocre. Same DSP story.  
>\>Fission*  
>Could be higher honestly. Bunny on crack, and upgraded 4U. Bass gimmick is still a switch, nozzle replacement is good mostly for repairability. The cable is the real show stealer: it's basically their Cable X  
>\>Origin  
>Their best built, most luxurious feeling IEM. Fit is not great, sound is on the bright side but still competent. Decent accessories but a bit disappointing for the price.  
>\>Mino  
>TWS with DSP at an affordable price that doesn't do anything outright wrong. Mediocre battery life, but apart from that a decent beater TWS.  
>\>Kara  
>First big departure for Tanchjim. Tuning is weird (not negative or positive). Same as Origin, feels a bit overpriced, comfort is not great, but it's also not exceptional in terms of build and feel.  
>\>4U  
>Bunny made out of metal but not as good. Overpriced for what it offers, bass switch is purely a gimmick, not useful.  
>\>Tanya  
>Decent bullet, but non-detachable cable is a big no-no for me personally. Does not help that the cable is bad.  
>\>Ola  
>There is the bass version (basically like the analog One) and the regular version (weird tuning, negative). Fit is disgusting.  
>\>Echo  
>Demo'd it once. Never again.  
>  
>Sources in next post, approaching limit
>>\>Stargate II*  
>>Looks solid, and includes DSP. No reports of weird behavior or very bad QC/failure.  
>>\>Luna  
>>One of the best measuring portable DAC/amp. A bit overpriced for what it offers, but it is built excellently.  
>>\>Cable X  
>>Tried it and returned it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great product, just not for me and overpriced for what is essentially just a cable with DSP.  
>>\>Space (and Lite version)*  
>>Not sure if they're discontinued but hey why not. Both irrelevant now with the Stargate II and Luna.  
>>\>VAST*  
>>Looks sick.
>>>where zero ultima
>>>>Below Mino  
>>>>\>Zero Ultima  
>>>>Quite literally the Bunny but in bullet form. Same tuning and DSP implementation and everything.  
>>>>Put lower because it has non-detachable cables, and Tanchjim stock cables of this type have always ended up stiffening up. Still a solid option, just not for me.
>>>>>I got a pair, and it is hands down the comfiest bullet I own. I don't know why nobody puts a nozzle at an angle to the body like Tanchjim does, but it is genius.
>>
>>>w-wait a sec- luna has no EQ?!?
>>>>None, which is why I don't recommend it to most. It's a good product and probably more than you'll ever need, but that's about it.
>>>>You get it for the engravings and to flex on retards here.
>>>>>sucks. but, yeah, no EQ means this:  
>>>>>\>You get it for the engravings and to flex on retards here.  
>>>>>is a solid assessment.  
>>>>>what a waste.

## Questyle CMA15 Impressions
*12/06/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/xdfKjs4G/Questyle-CMA15-Impressions.png)
>Totl anon here, got baited into buying the Questyle CMA15 last weekend. Just wanted to vent about this metal box:  
>\>Pros  
>\- Physical switch to toggle between amp and dac-only, this should make A/B-ing future amps easier.  
>\- Built like a shit brickhouse  
>\- Class A operation doesn’t get too hot (approx. 50°C~)  
>\- No audible noise-floor for IEMs. I’ve seen some reviews mention “power supply hum”, well I don’t hear it.  
>\- Current-driven amplification. Way more powerful than its specs (2W@32ohms) would suggest.
>  
>\>Cons  
>\- Too powerful, keeping the volume potentiometer on low naturally results in channel imbalance, but I can’t turn the volume up lest I blow my ears out. This issue is isolated to my Jomo Nautilus, so I’ve learnt to live with it.  
>\- NOT powerful enough for the Duality/Modhouse Tungsten/Susvara. Bass on the Duality still sounds mildly pillowy. Long-term I’m getting a better amp and relegating the Questyle to DAC duty.  
>\- Gain switch: Why did Questyle put that shit at the bottom? Also, you can’t change the gain while the unit is switched on. If changing gain was easier I wouldn’t be seething over the first con.  
>\- IIR filter: there’s only 1 filter and you can’t change it. Because of this HQPlayer has a very minimal effect.  
>\- No XLR input, only RCA.  
>
>\>Measurements  
[https://www.l7audiolab.com/f/questyle-cma-fifteen/](https://www.l7audiolab.com/f/questyle-cma-fifteen/)  
>
>\>Sound quality  
>Largely uncolored. Though the leading edge in the treble is a tad harsh – I’m getting mild sibilance when I didn’t used to. Fortunately, separation is way better than on the DX340 – some busy tracks sounded less congested on the Questyle. At least timbre isn’t dry and harsh like the Topping or I might actually kms from having bought this.  
> 
>Looking to buy the Mass-kobo 485 or Zahl H1 next so I don't have to cope with the amp stage of the CMA15. Fuck actually I want a proper R2R DAC too.

## Poweramp PEQ Accuracy
*08/06/2025*

Exchange was cut to only include relevant information regarding the PEQ implementation of Poweramp

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/6pd0p45K/Poweramp-PEQ-Accuracy-1.png)
>Poweramp Equalizer's PEQ applies filters in a non standard way for some unknown reason.  
>Android 13 broke viper4android a d magisk  
>JamesDSP can do it if you make the DCC file with IIR filters but won't actually apply globally.  
>  
>Take me back to 4.4
>>I said poweramp mot poweramp equalizer dummy. The music player app.
>>>The PEQ in regular Poweramp is better but still inaccurate.  
>>>My best option so far looks to be an LG v30 with lineageOS which is still cheaper than a qudelix 5k  
>>>Android truly is a terrible OS. It's quite something to have a worse audio stack than Windows.
>>>>![](https://i.postimg.cc/LsD3zd10/Poweramp-PEQ-Accuracy-2.png)
>>>>It's actually pretty much perfect.

## ARTTI R6 Impressions
*04/06/2025*

>![](https://i.postimg.cc/K8rP2XJv/ARTTI-R6-Impressions.png)
>Wow the Artti R6 is almost well tuned if you combined it with gate and averaged the two you’d basically get a spot on POS.
>I can tell you from my own personal experience the R6 is somewhat V-shaped with slightly off timbre for vocals but otherwise really not bad. Vocals are clear and present but have a bit too much “texture”(grain)
>\>Excellent for
>electronic music(dnb, house, swing, etc.)
>vidya gaymen(popping vocals are appreciated here amongst the cacophony. super engaging and enveloping)
>probably rap and hip hop, bass heavy stuff
>
>\>would not use for
>heavy orchestral, opera, classical
>\>decent for
>basically everything else
>
>Funny enough gate is kinda the opposite even though they both lean slightly bright.
>With deeper insertion gate becomes an all rounder for literally everything it is flat as a damn BOARD but with a bass boost and becomes slightly darker, more
>bouncy and dynamic(better)
>I may try deep insertion with the R6 but I don’t expect the same improvements
