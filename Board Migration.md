!!!danger What now?
Talk about timing. Not even a full year. Will probably be back soon enough, but what if it doesn't?
The plan for now will be to do a full archive of /iemg/, dating back as far as possible from available archives.

Here's a list of concurrent /iemg/ threads. Enter which board you prefer in the survey above if you have a preference. Ideally, /iemg/ shouldn't be fractured but who knows, if you prefer having split regions for different anons then I don't mind. My initial impressions of both are middling, although I lean towards 8chan.moe for the UIDs and seemingly higher post quality.

[8chan.moe thread](https://8chan.moe/t/res/17869.html) - More on the measurement and impressions/reviews side of /iemg/
[Sharty / soyjak.party thread](https://www.soyjak.st/tech/thread/5486.html) - Mix of /iemg/ and /hpg/, more on the shitpost/advice side of /iemg/


For now, a [SimpleX chat](https://simplex.chat/contact#/?v=2-7&smp=smp%3A%2F%2F1OwYGt-yqOfe2IyVHhxz3ohqo3aCCMjtB-8wn4X_aoY%3D%40smp11.simplex.im%2FJI2RGyykbaYWF8UVH2vCp5AN6TpoE6gE%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-3%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEAWUPhhQmk1HQNd3kgpoMc7sBfeHdYUUxFMzGl7ls3wUw%253D%26srv%3D6ioorbm6i3yxmuoezrhjk6f6qgkc4syabh7m3so74xunb5nzr4pwgfqd.onion&data=%7B%22groupLinkId%22%3A%22LfNt1CKFAj11qOR7Di6p0A%3D%3D%22%7D) will be used if anyone wants to discuss what is going to happen and our options.
